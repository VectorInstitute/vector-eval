The Ponies are riding high again, having guaranteed their fifth consecutive winning season. Such success hasn’t been seen in Dallas since the years that led to SMU’s ignominious Death Penalty, which suspended its program in 1987 and ’88.

SMU is 7-2, 5-0 in its final go-round in the American Athletic Conference. And here comes North Texas (3-6, 1-4), which has dropped four of its past five games and allows 37.4 points to its foes, ninth-worst in the nation.

The Mustangs get a national ESPN2 audience Friday in a 9 p.m. ET kickoff.

When looking at North Texas vs. SMU odds, props and predictions, the recent past gives us a pretty good window into what to expect: Over the previous four seasons, SMU has clamped down on North Texas by scores of 48-10, 35-12, 65-35 and 49-27, covering the spread each time and comfortably in all but one.

North Texas at SMU odds: Point spread, moneyline, total

Here are the latest college football betting odds for the Mean Green vs. Mustangs:

This opened Mustangs -14 and an exorbitant total of 71.5 in Vegas, which had shifted to 16 and 67.5, respectively, 24 hours later. Two of our three models have SMU winning by 22 and 18 points, so the spread grabs our attention.

North Texas betting news: There’s no 'D' in Mean Green

This will be a challenge for North Texas because SMU possesses a top-10 defense, allowing foes only 0.251 points per play; which only stiffens (to 0.185) when the Ponies play at home.

The North Texas defense is 12th from the D-I basement, giving up 0.501 ppp; and an even looser 0.533 on the highway.

SMU’s 20th-rated offense (0.483) sharpens to a ridiculous 0.662 at home—the only squads more efficient in their own yards are USC (0.780), LSU (0.762), Oregon (0.712) and Washington (0.690).

The definition of élite.

Until he had two passes picked off last Saturday in a 38-20 defeat to UTSA, junior QB Chandler Jones had thrown 262 passes through seven games with 19 TDs and no interceptions.

Jones, who started his career at Louisiana-Monroe, snatched the job from Stone Earle early in the season and hasn’t disappointed first-year coach Eric Morris.

The Mean Green defense has been another story, since allowing 681 total yards to Cal in the opener. Its past three foes have rung up 1,460 total yards and 15 TDs. Its yield of 479 yards per game is the worst in the country.

That sound you hear is SMU super sophomore QB Preston Stone licking his chops as he read that last sentence.

SMU betting news: Ponies on a stone-cold winning streak

The Mustangs are knotted atop the AAC with fellow 5-0 squads Tulane and UTSA. They’ve accumulated 1,685 total yards of offense in their past three games, including 91 first downs via passing, running or penalty, and 18 touchdowns.

By happy coincidence, no doubt for second-year SMU boss Rhett Lashlee, the defense has flexed over that span, yielding just 668 total yards, 39 total first downs and a mere four TDs.

When last seen at Gerald J. Ford Stadium, two weeks ago, rain might have kept fans away as only 20,800 filled the 32,000-capacity barn for SMU’s 69-10 homecoming belting of Tulsa.

Stone, playing near where he was raised, threw touchdown strikes of 74, 62 and 17 yards. By halftime, it was 52-3, the most Division I points tallied in the first 30 minutes this year.

The 6-foot-2 sophomore from Dallas has been heating up lately, perfect timing to continue improving SMU’s bowl prospects after a 2-2 start that included keen tests (and defeats) at Oklahoma and TCU.

The Mustangs own a five-game winning streak, and in his past four games Stone has thrown 122 passes, 10 for touchdowns and none for interceptions. He’s also run it in twice.

He threw for 300 yards against Prairie View A&M, and in this golden four-game stretch he’s accumulated 1,171 aerial yards.

Receivers RJ Maryland and Jordan Hudson have five TD catches apiece, and Roderick Daniels Jr. has four. Three others have two. Jaylan Knighton (511 yards, four TDs) paces the ground game.

However, Stone’s sterling development might have found a speed bump last week at Rice when he left early in the fourth quarter after getting hit hard. He zipped to the locker room and returned, minus his helmet.

If concussion protocol restricts him from playing Friday, look for redshirt freshman Kevin Jennings to start for SMU. He’s thrown 42 career passes, with 33 completions, four TDs and no picks.

Should Stone not play, we will call an audible and play Under this total. Monitor it closely and prepare to take action within an hour of kickoff.

North Texas at SMU prediction ATS

At home, the Mustangs average 0.3 giveaways per game, among the top seven teams in the country. On the road, North Texas coughs it up nearly twice a game, among the bottom third of D-I. Moreover, SMU is one of 14 programs that are the best-balanced squads in the country, passing and running between 49 and 51 percent of the time. Coaches pray for such balance. And the SMU defense, top 10 in key categories, will keep QB Jones and the Mean Green at bay.
