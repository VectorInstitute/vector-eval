Jerry Jones said earlier in the week that Sunday night's game would show him how the Cowboys stack up against the NFL's best.

The answer? Not very well.

Everything that could go wrong for Dallas on Sunday did go wrong, in a game that confirmed a 49ers team that ended the Cowboys' season in each of the last two years remains a level above its NFC counterpart.

The 49ers carved up Dallas' defense on the opening drive, and that was a sign of what was to come. Brock Purdy threw four touchdowns in the 42-10 rout, including three to George Kittle. Christian McCaffrey scored a touchdown for a 14th consecutive game as all of San Francisco's offensive weapons got involved.

Defensively, the 49ers were relentless. Nobody had a larger impact than Fred Warner, who finished the night with an interception, sack and forced fumble in a swarming performance.

The Cowboys' offense looked very much like it did in last season's playoff exit -- uncomfortable and out of sorts. Dallas was sluggish through the first half of the game, and the night unraveled quickly when Dak Prescott threw three interceptions in the second half. It got out of hand so quickly that Sam Darnold entered the game for the 49ers with more than 12 minutes remaining.

For Prescott and the Cowboys, questions about whether they can get over the hump against the class of the NFC will persist. While their wins have been dominant, Dallas already sits two games behind the Eagles in the NFC East.

The 49ers are rolling right along, with all of their major offensive weapons now healthy and the defense living up to its billing as well. San Francisco, now 5-0, doesn't face a team with a winning record until Week 10, though the Browns, Vikings and Bengals are far from automatic wins for Kyle Shanahan's team.

Cowboys vs. 49ers results, highlights from 'Sunday Night Football'

(All times Eastern)

Final: 49ers 42, Cowboys 10

11:26 p.m. â€” That'll do it! The 49ers trounce the Cowboys and reassert themselves as one of the NFL's most dominant teams. Through five games, San Francisco is unbeaten.

11:24 p.m. â€” These teams are trading possessions as the clock winds down. There was a brief skirmish officials had to break up as frustrations mount for Dallas.

11:14 p.m. â€” A sack by Kevin Givens ends Rush's first drive of the night and sets up a Bryan Anger punt. Backups are in nearly all around for the 49ers.

11:09 p.m. â€” Cooper Rush is in the game for the Cowboys...

11:07 p.m. â€” Mitch Wishnowsky with an excellent punt for the 49ers, who are just trying to get through the rest of the game injury-free.

11:04 p.m. â€” Sam Darnold has entered the game with 49ers. So, that's where we are with 12 minutes still on the clock.

11:00 p.m. INTERCEPTION â€” So much for that. Oren Burks gets the 49ers' third interception of the night as Prescott continues to struggle against this San Francisco defense.

10:59 p.m. â€” The Cowboys are moving the ball now, when it's a bit too late. Tony Pollard rips off a 26-yard run to finally break through.

49ers 42, Cowboys 10

10:53 p.m. TOUCHDOWN â€” And just like that, Jordan Mason runs in for another 49ers touchdown! This is ugly on all levels for the Cowboys, and Leighton Vander Esch is now down as well. 42-10, 49ers.

10:52 p.m. INTERCEPTION â€” Fred Warner now has a sack, forced fumble and an interception tonight. A pass from Prescott is deflected into his hands, and the 49ers have another instant scoring opportunity.

49ers 35, Cowboys 10

10:47 p.m. TOUCHDOWN â€” Purdy hits Kyle Juszczyk for the 49ers' fifth touchdown of the night. That's four touchdowns for Purdy alone, and San Francisco is pouring it all on the Cowboys.

End of third quarter: 49ers 28, Cowboys 10

10:43 p.m. â€” San Francisco is moving the ball inch-by-inch now, and the 'Niners are a yard away from making this a 25-point game.

10:38 p.m. â€” The 49ers are on the verge of entering the red zone after a 19-yard catch by Jauan Jennings. Purdy is up to 242 yards to go along with his three touchdowns.

10:32 p.m. INTERCEPTION â€” Prescott heaves it downfield under pressure and it's intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. For a Cowboys team that has embarrassed a few opponents this year, they might be on the bad end of an ugly game here.

49ers 28, Cowboys 10

10:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN â€” Not one, not two, THREE touchdowns for George Kittle. The 49ers have everything working offensively tonight, and any Kittle fantasy owners are thrilled.

10:25 p.m. â€” Aiyuk's loss is Deebo Samuel's gain. Samuel goes 43 yards on the very next play, which tells you how automatic the 49ers' offense is right now. San Francisco is in the red zone looking to make this a three-score game.

10:23 p.m. â€” An offensive holding call wipes out a 40-yard gain from Aiyuk. Wow. That's a momentum swing. Spencer Burford is the culprit.

10:21 p.m. â€” The Purdy-to-Aiyuk connection continues to get stronger. Aiyuk goes for 23 yards to give the 49ers some breathing room after opening their drive with a false start.

49ers 21, Cowboys 10

10:17 p.m. FIELD GOAL â€” The 49ers' defense tightens the screws and limits Dallas to a field goal. Brandon Aubrey drills it from 50 yards out, and it's down to a 21-10 lead for San Francisco.

10:13 p.m. â€” Prescott hits CeeDee Lamb for a big 29-yard gain. That quickly takes the Cowboys into 49ers territory to start the second half.

End of first half: 49ers 21, Cowboys 7

9:58 p.m. â€” San Francisco's defense is all over the Cowboys yet again. It's Dre Greenlaw's turn to sack Prescott, and Dallas is waving the white flag on the half. They'll start the second half with the ball.

9:56 p.m. â€” 49ers edge rusher Drake Jackson is walking off after requiring some medical attention on the field.

9:52 p.m. â€” The 49ers tried to put something together, but a third down pass to Aiyuk was too low. Dallas has a minute to try and get something before halftime.

9:45 p.m. â€” The Cowboys looked better on third down on their last drive, but Prescott's third down pass to Ferguson is short of the line to gain and ends this drive quickly. The 49ers will have a couple minutes to blow this game open before halftime.

49ers 21, Cowboys 7

9:38 p.m. TOUCHDOWN â€” McCaffrey pushes through for the touchdown. That's his 14th consecutive game finding the end zone, and it puts the 'Niners back up two scores.

9:37 p.m. â€” Deebo Samuel takes some big hits but gets the 49ers down to the one-yard line. San Francisco is knocking on the door again.

9:35 p.m. â€” The Cowboys had done a pretty nice job of containing McCaffrey to this point, but the former Pro-Bowler takes a screen pass for 19 yards to push the Niners to the edge of the red zone.

9:31 p.m. â€” Aiyuk with a quick 15-yard catch to start the 49ers' drive. He's up to 35 yards on three catches.

49ers 14, Cowboys 7

9:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN â€” KaVontae Turpin flashes his speed, gets separation, and hauls in Prescott's pass in the end zone! A perfectly drawn-up 26-yard play puts Dallas right back in this game.

9:24 p.m. â€” Prescott hits Jake Ferguson for a big third down conversion, and then some. That's 20 yards.

9:23 p.m. â€” Tony Pollard has had a tough night so far, with just 10 yards on six touches.

9:22 p.m. â€” Prescott fires a nice pass to Cooks to give the Cowboys another first down.

9:20 p.m. â€” The Cowboys have a first down! And it only took 17+ minutes. Dallas is still operating in its own territory, but it feels like points are needed on this drive to keep the game within reach.

49ers 14, Cowboys 0

9:14 p.m. TOUCHDOWN â€” That was quick! Purdy hits Kittle after some trickery, and it's a two-score night for the tight end. 49ers lead, 14-0.

9:13 p.m. â€” The Cowboys are forced to punt out of their own end zone after Fred Warner sacks Prescott. Warner now has a sack and a fumble. The 49ers will have strong field position.

9:10 p.m. FUMBLE â€” Oh no again! They're trading fumbles! Jourdan Lewis takes the ball right out of McCaffrey's arms and spoils the 49ers' hopes of making this a 14-0 game.

End of first quarter: 49ers 7, Cowboys 0

9:04 p.m. â€” Confirmed: 49ers ball. San Francisco has an instant opportunity here.

9:01 p.m. FUMBLE â€” Oh no! Pollard gets the ball knocked out deep in the Cowboys' own territory, and it looks like it was recovered by the 49ers. Officials are checking to make sure nobody was out of bounds, but that ball was very much out of Pollard's control. The 49ers could be set up in the red zone.

8:59 p.m. â€” The drive completely falls apart for the 49ers. A delay of game penalty sets San Francisco back, and Christian McCaffrey is dropped for a five-yard loss on 3rd & 15. Not allowing even a field goal is a huge win for Dallas.

8:56 p.m. â€” The 49ers are excelling on third down early in this game, and Purdy flips it to Kyle Juszczyk to keep the Niners' drive alive on 3rd & 1.

8:54 p.m. â€” Now Kearse lines up offsides... That extends the drive for the 49ers, who aren't moving as freely as they were on that opening drive.

8:50 p.m. â€” Jayron Kearse comes through with the Cowboys' first sack of the night, but Deebo Samuel makes up 11 of the 12 yards San Francisco needs on the next play.

8:46 p.m. â€” There's the first catch of the night for Lamb, but he doesn't get the first down and Dak Prescott is sacked by Nick Bosa to quickly end the drive. This 49ers defense has picked up right where it left off against the Cowboys in January.

8:44 p.m. â€” Dallas' second drive starts out with Tony Pollard getting dropped for a loss.

8:40 p.m. â€” Big-time stop by the Cowboys' defense as Johnathan Hankins deflects Purdy's third down pass with his helmet and forces a punt.

8:36 p.m. â€” The 49ers' defense was all over Dallas on that drive. Three plays, two incompletions, and now the Cowboys will punt it right back.

49ers 7, Cowboys 0

8:30 p.m. TOUCHDOWN â€” Purdy finds a wide open Kittle in the end zone for the score! That was a well-scripted opening drive by Kyle Shanahan, and San Francisco has an early 7-0 lead.

8:27 p.m. â€” A little bit of chaos as Deebo Samuel drops a ball that was pretty close to being a fumble, but it's all a non-issue as Dallas is hit with an offsides penalty. The 49ers are right about in field goal range.

8:25 p.m. â€” After a facemask penalty and a nine-yard pass to Brandon Aiyuk, the 49ers are already over midfield.

8:23 p.m. â€” Kickoff is a bit on the later end, but we are about to get underway. The 49ers will start with the ball.

8:10 p.m. â€” Jerry Jones said this week that this game will be a test of how the Cowboys match up with the NFL's best, as if there wasn't already pressure on Dallas to show something after the 49ers knocked them out of the playoffs in back-to-back years.

7:56 p.m. â€” Frank Gore and Vernon Davis are in the house! A couple greats from the 49ers' last golden era under Jim Harbaugh.

7:36 p.m. â€” CeeDee Lamb is coming off back-to-back games with only four catches. Is he due for a huge performance tonight?

7:11 p.m. â€” New 49ers acquisition Randy Gregory is officially inactive against his former team.

7:01 p.m. â€” The Eagles are going to win in Los Angeles, so the 49ers need a win to keep pace atop the NFC. After they had to play the last two NFC championship games on the road, the No. 1 seed is undoubtedly in the back of their minds.

6:45 p.m. â€” The run of great prime-time weather continues, as it's set to be in the high 70s and sunny in Santa Clara tonight. No excuses for these powerful offenses.

Cowboys vs. 49ers start time

Date: Sunday, Oct. 8

Sunday, Oct. 8 Start time: 8:20 p.m. ET (5:20 p.m. CT)

Sunday night's game between the Cowboys and 49ers is set to kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET (5:20 p.m. local time) from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

The 49ers and Cowboys have a long history with one another, but San Francisco has gotten the better of Dallas in each of their last two meetings. The 49ers knocked the Cowboys out of the playoffs in both of the last two seasons, so a win for Dallas on Sunday could be helpful just from a psychological standpoint.
