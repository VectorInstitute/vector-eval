Trying to predict the next NBA MVP is a popular betting option at the best sports betting sites.

Because the award has no set criteria for selection, it can be notoriously difficult to predict which player will walk away with the MVP trophy at the end of the season.

Who are the NBA MVP odds favorites?

Nikola Jokic: Falling short of a third consecutive MVP last season, Jokic steered Denver to its first NBA championship through an impressive playoff showing. During the summer, he emerged as a favored MVP candidate. As the Nuggets maintain their key lineup for another championship bid, Jokic consistently demonstrates his game prowess.

Luka Doncic: Doncic, among the preseason favorites for the past three years, has seen his prospects decline due to the Mavericks' limited support in Dallas, as underscored by their recent playoff absence. Although no one doubts Doncic's skills, questions about the Mavericks' contention capabilities persist.

Giannis Antetokounmpo: Last season, Milwaukee's surprising first-round departure against the Heat was notably influenced by Antetokounmpo's absence for much of the series. The two-time MVP, arguably the league's premier two-way player, is poised to rebound next season. At 28, in his prime, his resolve is stronger than ever following the Bucks' premature playoff exit.

Joel Embiid: Reigning MVP Embiid remains a prominent figure among top contenders. Despite the Sixers' playoff setbacks, he dominated the regular season, leading in scoring and showcasing superior rim defense. If he remains injury-free, Embiid is poised to vie for his MVP status again, hopefully with a strengthened supporting cast.

When should you bet on NBA MVP futures?

You can bet on the regular-season NBA MVP award well before the season starts. But when is the best time? That comes down to your tolerance for risk versus reward.

The odds are so favorable when the lines for NBA Most Valuable Player are first released because the oddsmakers, like you, have very little information to work with.

They are basing their odds on past performance and expected future accomplishments, as well as the quality of the team around the top candidates for the award. Thus, the odds are quite favorable.

While waiting for more information, such as a player’s performance during the regular season, the lines shift and become less favorable. That’s because the oddsmakers are gathering information and applying new data and analytics to their lines to make them as accurate as possible.

You must decide which approach works best for your betting strategy as a bettor. Do you want to wager when the lines are released with little information at your disposal but the best potential return on your bet, or do you want to wait until you have more solid information to craft your MVP speculation?

Who decides the NBA MVP winner?

The NBA MVP is selected annually by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters who vote for the players they believe are the best in the league.

This format, which started in 1980, sees each member of the panel vote for their top three players. Every first-place vote is worth five points, every second-place is worth three, and third-place is worth a single point.

One player rarely receives all of the first-place votes. That last happened in the 2015-16 season when Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors earned all possible first-place points.

Because there is no set criteria for awarding the regular-season NBA MVP, it’s notoriously difficult to predict who will get the nod. There are often late-season shifts among the favorites, and there are even seasons in which the winner is considered an upset and more prominent players are snubbed.
