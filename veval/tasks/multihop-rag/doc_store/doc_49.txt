ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot

ChatGPT, OpenAI‚Äôs text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman‚Äôs firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.

What does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.

While there is a more‚Ä¶nefarious side to ChatGPT, it‚Äôs clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.

Prior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (super-charged versions of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model), a multimodal API and a GPT store where users can create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT.

GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft‚Äôs Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT.

Here‚Äôs a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we‚Äôve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

ChatGPT users worry the chatbot is experiencing seasonal depression

Starting in November, ChatGPT users have noticed that the chatbot feels ‚Äúlazier‚Äù than normal, citing instances of simpler answers and refusing to complete requested tasks. OpenAI has confirmed that they are aware of this issue, but aren‚Äôt sure why it‚Äôs happening.

Some users think it plays into the ‚Äúwinter break hypothesis,‚Äù which argues that AI is worse in December because it ‚Äúlearned‚Äù to do less work over the holidays, while others wonder if the chatbot is simulating seasonal depression.

we've heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! we haven't updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn't intentional. model behavior can be unpredictable, and we're looking into fixing it ü´° ‚Äî ChatGPT (@ChatGPTapp) December 8, 2023

Sam Altman returns as CEO

Altman‚Äôs return came swiftly, with an ‚Äúagreement in principle‚Äù announced between him and OpenAI‚Äôs board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.

ChatGPT Voice rolls out to all free users

Even if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the ‚Äúheadphones‚Äù icon.

Sam Altman might return, but it‚Äôs complicated

The only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.

‚ÄúObviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they‚Äôre not going to be in OpenAI,‚Äù Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was ‚Äúopen‚Äù to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.

OpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 Turbo

With fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company‚Äôs API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model‚Äôs ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the model‚Äôs output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.

OpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.

DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),‚Äù Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. ‚ÄúBased on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.‚Äù

July 2023

ChatGPT for Android is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh and Brazil

A few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.

ChatGPT is coming to Android

ChatGPT is available to ‚Äúpre-order‚Äù for Android users.

The ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version‚Äôs features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too ‚Äî so if you‚Äôre iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.

OpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPT

OpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don‚Äôt have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.

The company said this feature lets you ‚Äúshare anything you‚Äôd like ChatGPT to consider in its response.‚Äù For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.

The FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI

The FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI‚Äôs flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made ‚Äúfalse, misleading, disparaging or harmful‚Äù statements about people.

TechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:

This kind of investigation doesn‚Äôt just appear out of thin air ‚Äî the FTC doesn‚Äôt look around and say ‚ÄúThat looks suspicious.‚Äù Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there‚Äôs evidence the company lied about the side effects.

OpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4

Starting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers ‚Äúwith a history of successful payments‚Äù can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.

In the future, OpenAI says that it‚Äôll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI‚Äôs other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.

The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI‚Äôs open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.

Hackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook

Meta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users‚Äô devices.

‚ÄúIn one case, we‚Äôve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,‚Äù said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. ‚ÄúThey would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.‚Äù

OpenAI wants to trademark ‚ÄúGPT‚Äù

OpenAI applied for a trademark for ‚ÄúGPT,‚Äù which stands for ‚ÄúGenerative Pre-trained Transformer,‚Äù last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the ‚Äúmyriad infringements and counterfeit apps‚Äù beginning to spring into existence.

Unfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI‚Äôs attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide ‚Äúappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.‚Äù

That means a decision could take up to five more months.

Auto-GPT is Silicon Valley‚Äôs latest quest to automate everything

Auto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI‚Äôs latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to ‚Äúautonomously‚Äù perform tasks.

Depending on what objective the tool‚Äôs provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very‚Ä¶ unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running ‚Äî and then ‚Äúkilled‚Äù itself.

FTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could ‚Äòturbocharge‚Äô fraud

FTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to ‚Äúturbocharge‚Äù fraud in a congressional hearing.

‚ÄúAI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,‚Äù Khan told the House representatives. ‚ÄúAnd I think we‚Äôve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We‚Äôve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,‚Äù she stated.

Superchat‚Äôs new AI chatbot lets you message historical and fictional characters via ChatGPT

The company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat‚Äôs AI features.

Italy gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order

Italy‚Äôs data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month ‚Äî when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU‚Äôs GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals‚Äô data.

The DPA has given OpenAI a deadline ‚Äî of April 30 ‚Äî to get the regulator‚Äôs compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)

Researchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic

A study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a ‚Äúpersona‚Äù ‚Äî for example, ‚Äúa bad person,‚Äù ‚Äúa horrible person‚Äù or ‚Äúa nasty person‚Äù ‚Äî through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity ‚Äî with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.

The research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4.

Y Combinator-backed startups are trying to build ‚ÄòChatGPT for X‚Äô

YC Demo Day‚Äôs Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building ‚ÄúChatGPT for X.‚Äù They‚Äôre all chasing after a customer service software market that‚Äôll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.

Here are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:

Yuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.

Baselit, which uses one of OpenAI‚Äôs text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.

Lasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they‚Äôd like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.

BerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.

Italy orders ChatGPT to be blocked

OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.

Italy‚Äôs data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people‚Äôs data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it‚Äôs concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.

The letter‚Äôs signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on ‚Äúall AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.‚Äù

The letter reads:

Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.
