The 64th edition of the League Cup (also known as the Carabao Cup after its sponsor) got underway on August 8 and we're now at the semifinal strage.

After the Community Shield won by Arsenal on August 6, the League Cup will be the first domestic trophy of the 2023/24 season awarded with the final to take place on Sunday, February 25, 2024 at Wembley Stadium in London.

Manchester United are the holders of the trophy after defeating Newcastle United in the 2023 final. Last season's finalists met in round four after being draw against one another, with the Magpies gaining revenge.

In addition to silverware, the winner of the EFL Cup earns a place in the 2024/25 UEFA Conference League playoffs with a chance to qualify for the group stage of that European cup competition.

How does the Carabao Cup work in 2023/24?

The EFL Cup (Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons) features all 92 participating clubs from the top four tiers of English football: Premier League (20 clubs), Championship (24 clubs), League One (24), and League Two (24).

The 12 Premier League clubs not involved in European cup competitions joined in the second Round, and the remaining eight sides joining in the third Round.

Why is it called Carabao Cup?

This knockout tournament has historically been called the League Cup or EFL Cup, which unlike the FA Cup which is overseen by the English Football Association (FA), is instead organised by the English Football League (EFL).

The EFL in the past incorporated each of the top four divisions of English football before the formation of the Premier League in 1992/93. Today, the EFL is comprised of the second-tier Championship, third-tier League One, and fourth-tier League Two. But Premier League clubs are still invited to participate in the League Cup (EFL Cup) every season.

Beginning in the 1990s, corporations began paying to attach their name to this tournament and the sponsor names caught on for brief periods when it was known as the Coca-Cola Cup, the Worthington's Cup, and the Carling Cup.

The latest sponsor is Thai energy drink company Carabao, which bought the title rights of the knockout tournament beginning with the 2017/18 edition, leading to the use of the Carabao Cup moniker that is popularly used today.
