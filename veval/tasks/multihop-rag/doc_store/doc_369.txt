Best NBA betting sites for 2023

When it comes to betting on the NBA, you can choose any online betting site and have plenty of odds to choose from.

You can bet everything from moneylines, totals, and point spreads to player props for scoring, rebounding, and assists, or futures bets like odd to win the Eastern Conference or individual award winners like NBA MVP odds.

Here are our favorite sportsbooks for NBA betting.

DraftKings Sportsbook for NBA betting

DraftKings is one of the most recognizable names in online sports betting, notably for its frequent promos to enhance NBA odds. The platform boasts a diverse range of prop bets tailored to the most prominent NBA players and provides a seamless live NBA betting experience through its app.

For newcomers, DraftKings has a lucrative offer. Upon joining, there's no need for a special code to take advantage of a promo with a total promotional value of up to $1,200.

In the past, DraftKings has run special promotions tailored to NBA enthusiasts. One such offer allowed customers to earn $200 in bonus bets simply by placing a $5 bet on any NBA Finals game. This highlights the company's commitment to delivering value for its dedicated betting community.

FanDuel Sportsbook for NBA betting

FanDuel is another name that resonates strongly within the NBA betting community, garnering popularity and success akin to its counterpart, DraftKings.

Alongside the standard NBA odds you'd expect, FanDuel stands out with its expansive selection of NBA players and game props. It also has a unique feature allowing users to create same-game parlays. This lets bettors combine NBA moneylines, totals, and props, crafting a personalized betting experience tailored to their predictions and preferences.

Newcomers to FanDuel’s online sportsbook can typically claim $150 in bonus bets. They may offer three months of NBA League Pass to sweeten the deal further. Claiming this promotion is straightforward: there's no need for a special FanDuel promo code. Prospective bettors must sign up, deposit, and place a $5 bet to be eligible.

BetMGM Sportsbook for NBA betting

BetMGM is known for its comprehensive odds markets, and the online sportsbook, coupled with its intuitive betting app, caters to a vast range of betting markets for all the premier sports. However, their NBA betting shines through as a significant highlight.

Setting it apart from the competition, BetMGM's sports betting app is the only one that offers live streaming of NBA games, so you can watch the action as you bet.

NBA promotions are abundant at BetMGM. Past promotions have included "bet $10, get $200." Under this promotion, bettors receive 20-1 odds, and their bet is deemed victorious as long as a single three-point field goal is scored in the game.

For a new account, the BetMGM Sportsbook usually has a bonus of up to $1,500. If your first bet loses you can still get the value back in bonus bets.

BetRivers Sportsbook for NBA betting

For those who like both sports betting and online casino games, BetRivers has an integrated app to switch between the two using a singular account.

BetRivers doesn't just stop at offering an integrated platform; they've also introduced the iRush Rewards program to elevate the betting experience. Unique in its approach, this program allows users to earn points as they place bets on sports.

What makes it particularly appealing is the flexibility: accumulated points can be utilized on BetRivers' online casino

Dedicated promotions are a hallmark of BetRivers, and their engagement with NBA fans is evident. A past promotion, dubbed "NBA Wednesdays," allowed users to wager up to $25 on any NBA game scheduled on a Wednesday.

The sweetener? A 20% profit boost if the bet was successful. New accounts typically can claim a second-chance bet that could reach up to $500, although this amount might differ based on the state.

Understand the variety of deposit methods the sportsbook offers.

For payouts, know the withdrawal methods and wait times.

Be aware of any limits or restrictions on withdrawals.

NBA Odds:

Always select betting sites offering the best NBA odds for long-term benefits.

For instance, consider using both if one book offers the Boston Celtics at +800 and another at +1500.

Assess how easy it is to navigate the site.

Gauge the efficiency of customer support.

Ensure the site has a responsible gaming section.

The overall user experience should be smooth and hassle-free.

Safety and Security:

Top NBA betting sites prioritize users' safety.

Ensure your personal information is secure.

How to find the best NBA lines

Not all sportsbook betting odds are created equal. If you're willing to put in some legwork, you can shop for the best NBA lines to maximize your potential return.

Movement in the odds depends on multiple factors, including team news, injuries, public betting, recent play, and even the number of games a team plays in a row.

Oddsmakers use all the available information to craft their lines, and you can find value in shopping around for the most favorable lines and odds.

You can use our NBA odds page (see link above) to find the best lines for your prospective bet, or you can open accounts at multiple sportsbooks and do the shopping yourself.

Either way, the line shopping strategy is designed to help you maximize your potential return.

NBA live betting

Thanks to the increased popularity of online sports betting apps, in-game betting has exploded nationwide. Also known as live betting, in-game betting allows you to bet on a game while it’s unfolding.

The action is fast, and the odds are constantly shifting, making for a new way to enjoy the flow of a game while still staying engaged as a bettor.

Depending on the sportsbook, there is usually a strong variety of live betting opportunities. You’ll find game and player prop bets like whether the next bucket will be worth one, two, or three points.

You can bet on the team leading at the end of the current quarter or on whether there will be a comeback victory. You can even boil live betting down to the results of the next possession.

The most popular sportsbook apps, such as DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM, offer NBA in-game betting, though each has its lines and betting opportunities.

What makes NBA betting special or unique?

Basketball odds are known to fluctuate more than those of other sports. The factors that play into those lines shifting can range from having only a few impact players per team to the sheer frequency of games.

By following a single team, you can track its momentum swings, which players tend to get on hot or cold streaks, or how well they play at home vs. on the road. You can use that information to your advantage for both pre-game and live wagers.

Similar categories of moneylines, spreads, totals, and NBA prop bets should appear across both formats.

The NBA is also special because of the number of bets available for every game, ranging from pre-game to live betting and parlays.

When you add up the standard bets, game props, player props, in-game betting, and more, there’s a staggering volume of bets for every NBA game at online sportsbooks.

NBA spreads, money lines, and over/unders

For anyone new to NBA betting, the staple wager types are:

NBA point spreads: Bet on games via margins of victory or loss. Say the New York Knicks are -7.5 favorites over the Miami Heat. That means the Knicks need to win the game by 8 points to win a spread bet. On the other hand, the Heat can lose by up to 7 points (or win outright).

NBA moneylines: The simplest form of betting. You pick the winner of the game, and if you’re right, you’ll get paid out based on the odds when you finalize your bet slip. Favorites to win the game are shown negative odds, such as -135, while the underdogs will have positive odds, like +165.

NBA over/under bets: Also known as totals. These bets are focused on the combined point total of the two teams playing in a game. (Winners and losers don’t matter.) For example, the over/under could be set at 211.5 points in the Knicks vs. Heat matchup. If you were to pick the over on the bet, you’d need the two teams to combine for 212 points or more to win. They need to score 211 points or fewer if you went with the under.

NBA props and futures

NBA player and team props are growing in popularity. Sportsbooks are taking note and providing more NBA props than ever.

After all, it’s much easier to focus on a single player and how he will perform than the entire team. Player props could focus on how many points a player scores or how many rebounds he pulls down. These are typically provided in an over/under format.

Then, team props can range from which team will score the first bucket to the total points scored in a quarter to which team will lead at halftime. The selection is often robust, especially when high-profile teams play.

Futures bets are exactly what their name implies: bets on events that will happen in the future. Common futures markets include:

and much more. You can usually bet on NBA futures odds throughout the year, including well before the season starts and throughout the regular season. The further away from the event, the more likely you will find heavier odds in your favor.

Is NBA betting legal in the U.S.?

In the US, the landscape of sports betting, specifically NBA betting, has evolved considerably. While NBA betting is permitted, its legality varies across the nation. The significant turning point came in 2018 when the US Supreme Court made a pivotal decision. It overturned a longstanding federal law and allowed individual states the autonomy to determine their own sports betting regulations.

This groundbreaking decision sparked a wave of change. Since that landmark ruling, over 30 states have embraced sports betting, including wagers on the NBA. For those residing or visiting betting-friendly states, the experience promises fairness and security.

State-regulated online betting platforms are in place, ensuring that bettors receive fair odds. Furthermore, these platforms adhere to strict standards, ensuring a safe and transparent betting environment for everyone involved.
