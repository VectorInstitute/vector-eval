The Rangers found themselves one strike away from a championship twice in 2011. They couldn't finish the job. On Wednesday night, they'll have a chance to avenge that painful finish.

Texas found out before Tuesday's Game 4 that slugger Adolis Garcia's season was over, but a talented lineup didn't miss a beat. The Rangers erupted for five runs in the second inning and five more in the third, bludgeoning Arizona's bullpen to take a 10-0 lead in the blink of an eye.

Corey Seager came through with his third home run of the series, while Marcus Semien drove in five of the Rangers' first 10 runs — including a three-run blast that put Texas up by double digits.

FAGAN: Three things Diamondbacks need to flip script on World Series

The Diamondbacks have earned a reputation for not backing down, and to their credit, they didn't. Arizona scored six runs over the final two innings, putting together competitive at-bats despite the dramatic deficit and forcing the Rangers to go to closer Jose Leclerc for the final out.

Still, it wasn't nearly enough. The Diamondbacks' best hope is that their late-game surge carries over to Game 5, where they will face elimination for the third time in this postseason.

The Rangers just need one more win to become World Series champions, and they will have the right man on the mound in Game 5 as Nathan Eovaldi makes his sixth start of the postseason. Zac Gallen, who was less than sharp in October but earned Cy Young consideration during the regular season, will start for the Diamondbacks with everything on the line for Arizona.

11:14 p.m. — Marte swings at a pitch well out of the zone and strikes out.

11:13 p.m. — Perdomo singles into the gap and sends Lawlar over to third. Arizona has a little something brewing here.

11:12 p.m. — Lawlar with a very professional plate appearance for a player who was just called up in September. He starts the inning with a walk.

11:09 p.m. — It'll be rookie Jordan Lawlar facing Will Smith to lead off the inning.

11:07 p.m. — Chris Stratton warmed up to start the inning, but Bruce Bochy is making a change after seeing Pavin Smith enter as a pinch-hitter.

11:04 p.m. — Jung quickly grounds into an inning-ending double play. Now the Diamondbacks just need six runs in the bottom of the ninth to extend the game.

10:34 p.m. — Semien strikes out to end the inning for the Rangers.

10:20 p.m. — Cody Bradford is into the game to pitch for Texas.

10:17 p.m. — Nelson still gets through the inning unscathed as he preserves what's left of the Diamondbacks bullpen for Game 5.

10:15 p.m. — The first baserunner allowed by Nelson is Josh Jung, who has a three-hit night for the Rangers.

10:09 p.m. — It's just not the Diamondbacks' day (if you couldn't already tell). Gurriel grounds into an inning-ending double play to end that threat.

10:07 p.m. — Walker and Pham put back-to-back singles on the board with one out.

10:01 p.m. — Nelson strikes out Seager, whose World Series MVP case might be hurt by the fact he's hitting under .200 in the series. Onto the bottom of the sixth.

9:59 p.m. — Ryne Nelson is doing his part, at least. He's retired the first eight hitters he's faced with Seager now coming to the plate.

9:53 p.m. — The middle of the fifth inning is MLB's annual Stand Up to Cancer tribute. A fantastic moment at Chase Field.

9:44 p.m. — Make it 6-for-6 for Nelson, who has coasted through two scoreless innings. Let's see if Arizona can put any pressure at all on the Rangers.

9:43 p.m. — Nelson gets the first two outs without incident. He's retired all five batters he's faced.

9:40 p.m. — Fan on the field! At least there's some action.

9:37 p.m. — Heaney retires Alek Thomas, so the Diamondbacks come away from that opportunity with only one run. They're going to need more.

Rangers 10, Diamondbacks 1

9:35 p.m. SACRIFICE FLY — Gurriel hits one a long way to right field, but it's caught near the warning track. Still, it's a run. Moreno scores to put Arizona on the board.

9:33 p.m. — Tommy Pham works a 3-1 count, but Heaney comes right back and strikes him out looking.

9:30 p.m. — Walker quickly lines one down the left field line for a double. The Diamondbacks have runners on second and third with nobody out.

9:29 p.m. — Moreno walks to open the bottom of the fourth.

9:27 p.m. — Nelson retires Carter and Jung, so it's a much-needed quick inning by Diamondbacks pitching. Now it's just up to Arizona's offense to put up 10 or so runs.

9:24 p.m. — Ryne Nelson strikes out Garver to open the fourth.

9:20 p.m. — Nathaniel Lowe makes the play to retire Carroll, and that will bring the Rangers back up to bat with a 10-0 lead.

9:16 p.m. — Perdomo grounds out up the middle for the second out of the inning.

9:15 p.m. — Emmanuel Rivera opens the bottom of the third with a lineout.

A 3-RUN HOMER FROM SEMIEN MAKES IT 10-0 @Rangers! 😱

Rangers 7, Diamondbacks 0

9:08 p.m. 2-RUN DOUBLE — Who needs Adolis Garcia? Jankowski comes through with a massive 2-run double and puts the Rangers up 7-0. Texas is all over the Diamondbacks' bullpen.

The Rangers tack on two more runs 😳



📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/AWYICKRMiq — FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) November 1, 2023

9:06 p.m. — Luis Frias strikes out Taveras and has a chance to wiggle out of this against Jankowski.

9:03 p.m. — Disaster. Christian Walker had a chance to turn two but couldn't hold onto the ball. The Rangers have the bases loaded with one out.

8:59 p.m. — Lowe keeps the line moving and laces a single up the middle. The Rangers have two runners on with one out. This one could get even more out of hand for Arizona. Kyle Nelson's night is done.

8:53 p.m. — Thomas flies out to left to end the inning.

8:51 p.m. — Gurriel hits a two-out single to give the Diamondbacks a pulse. That'll bring up Alek Thomas.

Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0

8:39 p.m. 2-RUN TRIPLE — There goes Semien! He hits on just inside the foul line, and it takes an eternity for Lourdes Gurriel Jr. to get to it. Two runs score. It's 3-0, Rangers.

2-run triple for Marcus Semien!



The @Rangers came out swinging!



📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/Je43lpXXMi — FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) November 1, 2023

The @Rangers strike first in Game 4!



📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/E5FCruQby7 — FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) November 1, 2023

8:33 p.m. — Jung gets moved over to third on a chopper by Heim, who is out at first. Leody Taveras has a two-out RBI opportunity.

8:31 p.m. — Miguel Castro is in to face Heim with one out and Jung at second.

8:29 p.m. — Mantiply quickly strikes out Lowe for the first out of the inning, and that will be the end of his day.

8:27 p.m. — Keeping Mantiply in to face Josh Jung was not successful. Jung belts a double into the gap and gives Texas a leadoff runner in scoring position. Mantiply will stay in to face Nathaniel Lowe.

8:25 p.m. — The Diamondbacks are sticking with Mantiply to start the second inning.

8:23 p.m. — Heim nabs Marte on the stolen base attempt! That'll end the inning. A quick momentum shift back to the Rangers after the leadoff Marte single.

8:21 p.m. — Another strikeout for Heaney, who gets Moreno. The Diamondbacks are making him work, but he's getting the job done early.

8:18 p.m. — Heaney bounces back with a strikeout of Corbin Carroll.

8:15 p.m. — Ketel Marte's hitting streak reaches 20 as he singles up the middle to lead off the bottom of the first.

📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/GJoEF1GVKj — FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) November 1, 2023

8:08 p.m. — Seager swings at the first pitch and sends it deep into the outfield, but it's caught comfortably for the second out.

8:08 p.m. — Semien works a full count, but Geraldo Perdomo gets things started with a great defensive play to get him for the first out.

8:05 p.m. — Joe Mantiply is ready. Marcus Semien is ready. Game 4 of the World Series is underway with a strike.
