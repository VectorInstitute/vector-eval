The SEC East champs put on a show, to say the least. Georgia dominated against ninth-ranked Ole Miss, coming up with a 52-17 win to earn a date with Alabama in the SEC Championship Game in December. All-American tight end Brock Bowers returned to the field for his final homestead only 26 days after TightRope surgery. Starting against the Rebels, he had three catches for 34 yards, adding a touchdown in the fourth quarter. He missed just two games after suffering the high ankle sprain against Vanderbilt on Oct. 14. Georgia didn't need him, though, as the running backs had themselves a night for both teams. Kendall Milton and Daijun Edwards scored two touchdowns each as the Bulldogs finished with 300 rushing yards. Milton ended the night with a career-high 127 yards. For Ole Miss, Quinshon Judkins scored the only two touchdowns and finished with 75 yards. Unfortunately for Rebels, injury continues to plague them after Micah Pettus, the team's top lineman, was ruled out with a broken foot bone he sustained during practice. Quarterback Jaxson Dart left the game at the end of the third quarter after a hit from two Georgia defenders. He held his collarbone as he entered the injury tent. He was taken back to the locker room for further examination and did not return to the game, leaving it in the hands of Spencer Sanders. Before his exit, Dart passed for 112 yards and one interception. Sanders finished it up with 61 yards on four completions. For the Dawgs, Carson Beck finished with 306 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. It's the fourth game this season with over 300 yards and at least two touchdowns. In its trip to the SEC Championship for the third-straight year, Georgia will face Alabama, who it lost to in 2021. A dominant win over the Rebels surely inspires some confidence with two regular season games left. We'll see if the victory was enough to overtake Ohio State as the top team in College Football Playoff rankings.

5:15 p.m. â€“ The weather in Athens is anything but ideal for a top-10 matchup. It'll be in the 40s with a chance of rainfall throughout the evening. But is that better for the Dawgs? Last time ESPN's College Gameday was in town for a crucial SEC matchup, Georgia beat Tennessee on a rainy afternoon. Kirby Smart and his crew seem to only get better in rough weather.
