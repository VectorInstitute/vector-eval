6d ago 23.36 GMT Jos Buttler‚Äôs reaction We probably didn‚Äôt adapt quickly enough with the bat ‚Äì I thought 16o w0uld have been a decent score on a used wicket. It was a fantastic bowling effort; we did well to hang in the game as long as we did. Phil Salt has had a brilliant series. We found out lots about ourselves as a team. [On the stop-clock experiment] It was only in the last game that we really noticed it. It‚Äôs good to keep the game moving.



6d ago 23.19 GMT England‚Äôs miserable white-ball year ends with another series defeat. Plenty of good has come from this series, though, most notably the performance of Phil Salt. While there are a few slots to fill, most notably at No3, they are in reasonable shape ahead of nexr year‚Äôs World Cup.

6d ago 23.16 GMT I suppose it‚Äôs appropriate that it ended with a six, the 120th of the series. Hope played a gem of an innings there, calmly anchoring West Indies in an increasingly nervous chase with a run-a-ball 43. England fought admirably to defend a below-par total; but for Hope, they would probably have done it.

6d ago 23.13 GMT 19.1 overs: West Indies 127-6 (Hope 37, Holder 4) Holder inside edges Woakes this far wide of leg stump for three runs. It would have been four but for an outstanding stop from Rehan Ahmed.



6d ago 23.12 GMT 19th over; West Indies 124-6 (Hope 37, Holder 1) Holder is almost run out first ball! He took a very dodgy single to mid-off and was well short of the crease when Curran just failed to gather Rashid‚Äôs throw. Nine to win from six balls, Chris Woakes to bowl them.



6d ago 23.10 GMT WICKET! West Indies 123-6 (Russell c Livingstone b Curran 3) Oh my. Russell slugs a low full toss straight down the throat of Livingstone at long-on, and England ‚Äì who have been behind the game throughout this innings ‚Äì are again dreaming of an improbable victory. West Indies need 10 from 7 balls.



6d ago 23.09 GMT 18.4 overs: West Indies 123-5 (Hope 37, Russell 3) Sam Curran concedes only one run from the first four balls of a superb penultimate over. The ball is getting very wet, though, so there‚Äôs a short break in play while England call for a dry towel. West Indies need 10 from 8 balls.



6d ago 23.04 GMT 18th over: West Indies 122-5 (Hope 36, Russell 3) Jos Buttler gambles by continuing with Rehan Ahmed, who has been relatively expensive. It doesn‚Äôt come off: Hope skims a back cut between short third and backward point for four to move the requirement back below a run a ball. It‚Äôs very hard to see how England can with this now.



6d ago 23.00 GMT 17th over: West Indies 114-5 (Hope 30, Russell 1) The wicket England really need is that of Shai Hope, who is quietly guiding West Indies towards the finish line.



6d ago 22.57 GMT WICKET! West Indies 113-5 (Powell c Rashid b Topley 8) England haven‚Äôt given this up. Powell edges Topley to short third man, where Rashid takes a smart low catch to his left. West Indies need 20 from 21 balls. Reece Topley (right) celebrates the dismissal of Rovman Powell. Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images

6d ago 22.54 GMT 16th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 29, Powell 8) Hope, who is playing an exemplary innings, opens the face to steer Rehan for his first boundary. Rehan has struggled as the series has progressed, an d later in the over Powell muscles him over long-on for six. West Indies are 21 runs away from a hat-trick of T20 series wins this year: South Africa away, India and England at home.



6d ago 22.50 GMT 15th over: West Indies 99-4 (Hope 23, Powell 1) Rashid finishes with figures of 4-0-21-2. He‚Äôs had a great series: eight wickets at 15 with an absurd economy rate of 6.26. But he‚Äôs going to end on the losing side.



6d ago 22.48 GMT WICKET! West Indies 95-4 (Rutherford c Curran b Rashid 30) Buttler brings back Rashid for his final over, knowing it‚Äôs now or never for England, and gets an immediate reward. Rutherford smashes a drive towards short extra, where Curran dives to his left to take a superb catch. It‚Äôs not the despair, Laura‚Ä¶



6d ago 22.45 GMT 14th over: West Indies 94-3 (Hope 19, Rutherford 30) West Indies are rushing towards a series victory. Rutherford hooks the new bowler Sam Curran for six more, and there are 11 from the over in total. Rutherford has 30 from 23 balls, Hope 19 from 28. They‚Äôre playing their roles to perfection.



6d ago 22.40 GMT 13th over: West Indies 83-3 (Hope 17, Rutherford 21) Rehan Ahmed returns, perhaps in the hope of tempting Rutherford into one big shot too many. Instead it‚Äôs Shai Hope, who is happily playing the anchor role, who faces five of the six deliveries. England are running out of time.



6d ago 22.37 GMT 12th over: West Indies 80-3 (Hope 15, Rutherford 20) England appeal unsuccessfully for caught behind when Rutherford misses a swipe at Rashid. There‚Äôs only one review left and they decide not to risk it. A good job too; there was nothing on UltraEdge. Out of nothing Rutherford launches a full ball from Rashid down the ground for six, almost knocking himself off his feet in the process. West Indies are managing an awkward chase pretty well.



6d ago 22.33 GMT 11th over: West Indies 71-3 (Hope 14, Rutherford 12) After 23 balls without a West Indian boundary, Rutherford lifts Moeen handsomely over extra cover for four. That‚Äôs an excellent shot which keeps West Indies in control of the run-chase.

Updated at 22.33 GMT

6d ago 22.28 GMT 10th over: West Indies 62-3 (Hope 12, Rutherford 5) West Indies know how dangerous Rashid is and are content to sit on him. I think that was Charles‚Äô plan as well, but then he saw a low full toss and his brain went rogue. Time for drinks, after which West Indies need 71 from 60 balls.



6d ago 22.25 GMT Rutherford is not out! I need someone else‚Äôs glasses: it was comfortably missing leg stump and England have lost a review.



6d ago 22.25 GMT ENGLAND REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST RUTHERFORD! This looks really close. Rutherford pushed around a legbreak from Rashid and was hit on the pad in front of middle and leg.



6d ago 22.24 GMT 9th over: West Indies 58-3 (Hope 11, Rutherford 2) Moeen replaces Rehan and rushes through a pretty good over, four singles from it. West Indies are still on top but another wicket would make things very interesting.



6d ago 22.21 GMT WICKET! West Indies 54-3 (Charles c Buttler b Rashid 27) Adil Rashid strikes straight away. On this occasion it had nothing to do with his bowling, but maybe a little to do with his aura. He accidentally bowled a very wide, dipping full toss to Charles, who clunked it low to Jos Buttler at short extra cover. Adil Rashid (right) celebrates the dismissal of Johnson Charles (left).

6d ago 22.17 GMT 7th over: West Indies 51-2 (Charles 26, Hope 7) Rehan Ahmed‚Äôs first over disappears for 12. It started quite gently, with four singles and a two off the first five balls, but then Charles clattered a no-nonsense straight six. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to win this, Rob,‚Äù writes Guy Hornsby. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm just here to say I‚Äôm still watching for Woakes‚Äô seam position and Rehan‚Äôs googly. That is all.‚Äù



6d ago 22.13 GMT 6th over: West Indies 39-2 (Charles 16, Hope 5) Charles mistimes a short ball from Woakes just short of Moeen in the covers. In the end Moeen does well to save the boundary. This has been a good fightback by England, with only nine runs scored in the last three overs.



6d ago 22.09 GMT 5th over: West Indies 37-2 (Charles 15, Hope 4) Topley continues, which makes sense because the spinners will be doing most of the work after the Powerplay, and concedes only three runs. He has quietly had a good series and is comfortably the most economical seamer on either side.



6d ago 22.05 GMT 4th over: West Indies 34-2 (Charles 15, Hope 1) England needed early wickets to have a realistic chance of victory. One more in the Powerplay, before they bring on Adil Rashid, would put them right back in the game.



6d ago 22.03 GMT WICKET! West Indies 33-2 (Pooran b Woakes 10) UltraEdge shows Pooran did edge that ball from Topley ‚Äì but it doesn‚Äôt matter because Woakes has got him! Pooran tried to ride the bounce of an awkward delivery that cramped him for room, took the inside of an angled bat and ricocheted onto the stumps. Nicholas Pooran looks glum as his bails go flying.

6d ago 21.59 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 30-1 (Charles 13, Pooran 9) Nicholas Pooran strolls to the crease and launches his second ball over midwicket for six. And why not. England thought he had edged the next ball to the keeper, though eventually they ran out of time to review. West Indies need 103 from 17 overs. ‚ÄúEvening Rob,‚Äù says Kim Thonger. ‚ÄúJolly exciting this game, in a damaged sort of way. It occurs to me perhaps T20 internationals need a complete rebrand. May I propose we rename them Ecky Thump. The term was Introduced in Kung Fu Kapers, a 1975 episode of BBC comedy The Goodies. In the episode, ‚Äòecky thump‚Äô is a secret Lancastrian martial art using black puddings as a weapon. I‚Äôm not suggesting we go as far introducing black puddings immediately. A phased withdrawal of the cricket bat will cause less fuss.‚Äù But what would you call The Hundred? Bloody Eck?

6d ago 21.54 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 20-0 (King 3, Charles 13) Johnson Charles was playher of the match when West Indies beat England at the T20 World Cup 11 years ago. Charles walloped 84 off 56 balls that day, and he looks like he fancies something similar here. He pulls Woakes for a big six, albeit with a hint of top-edge, and glides a boundary past short third man. West Indies are off to a flyer.



6d ago 21.49 GMT 1st over: West Indies 7-0 (King 1, Charles 2) There‚Äôs some early inswing to the right-handers for Reece Topley. Brandon King survives an LBW appeal first ball ‚Äì it was missing leg ‚Äì before another inswinger to Johnson Charles runs away for four leg-byes. Every boundary hurts when the target is so low, even in the first over.



6d ago 21.45 GMT After a very short break, the players are back on the field.



6d ago 21.39 GMT The difference two days make Tuesday, Tarouba England 267-3, 19 sixes

Thursday, Taroura England 132 all out, five sixes

Updated at 21.45 GMT

6d ago 21.36 GMT WICKET! England 132 all out (Curran c Rutherford b Holder 12) Sam Curran clouts the next ball to long-off to end an increasingly miserable England innings. They were 109 for four after 14 overs, and then the house fell down. West Indies need 133 to win the series.

Updated at 21.38 GMT

6d ago 21.33 GMT WICKET! England 132-9 (Rashid run out 1) Adil Rashid sacrifices himself, just like in the 2019 World Cup final, so that Curran can stay on strike. Four balls remaining.



6d ago 21.31 GMT 19th over: England 129-8 (Curran 9, Rashid 1) The hat-trick ball is another attempted yorker that Rashid flicks wide of Russell for a single. He would have had three wickets in four balls had Hosein taken a tricky low chance at third man to dismiss Curran. Russell, who bowled really well, finishes with two for 25.
