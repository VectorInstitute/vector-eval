Point spread betting is a bet on the difference in the score between teams (or players) in a specific game or event. The favored team is provided a point spread or handicap to try to equalize the odds with the less-favored team.

To place a point spread bet, select either the favored team or the underdog and predict if they will surpass or fall short of the given point spread. The odds for both teams are set to try to even out the bets on both sides.

The best sports betting sites provide a daily menu of point spread bets in dozens of sports and events.

What is a point spread bet?

A point spread is a predetermined margin set by bookmakers to level the playing field between two teams. Then, you bet on whether:

The favored team will win by more than the spread

or

The underdog will lose by less than the spread (or just win outright)

In a point spread, the favorite is the team expected to win and is typically assigned a negative point value, indicating the number of points by which they need to win for a bet on them to be successful.

The underdog is the team expected to lose and is typically assigned a positive point value, indicating the number of points they can lose by for a bet on them to be successful.

If the underdog wins the contest outright, they’re also the spread winner.

What does betting ‘against the spread’ mean?

Most generally, betting against the spread just means placing a point spread bet.

You’re betting on the underdog to either win outright or lose by fewer points than the specified point spread, or you’re betting on the favorite to win by a margin greater than the specified point spread.

In a secondary definition that distinguishes between betting “with the spread” or “against the spread,” the latter term means you’re betting on the underdog.

What does ‘covering the spread’ mean?

Covering the spread means that a team has surpassed the expectations set by the point spread and, thus, won the bet.

For the favorite, it means they won by more than the specified number of points. For the underdog, it means they either won outright or lost by fewer points than the specified spread.

How do point spread odds work?

Alongside point spread bets, the odds will indicate the potential payout relative to the wagered amount. These odds are typically close to even because the point spread is designed to level the playing field between two teams.

The odds can be presented in various formats, such as American (e.g., -110 or +110), Decimal (e.g., 1.91), and Fractional (e.g., 10/11), each providing a different way to express the same potential payout.

Do point spread odds change?

Yes, point spread odds can change, and these shifts are commonly referred to as "line movement."

Lines move when the point spread or the odds associated with a particular bet change after sportsbooks have initially set them. There are several reasons for these adjustments.

One of the most common causes is an imbalance in the amount of money being wagered on one side of the bet. If a significant majority of bettors are placing their money on one team to cover the spread, the top sports betting apps will adjust the point spread to make the other side more appealing, thereby balancing the betting action.

Another factor that can affect the spread odds is the occurrence of unexpected events, such as injuries to key players, changes in team strategies, or even significant weather events that might impact a game's outcome.

For instance, if a star quarterback is announced as injured just days before a big game, the point spread might shift in favor of the opposing team.

Moreover, information and public perception play a role. If a piece of news or a prevailing sentiment starts to gain traction about a particular team's increased chances of winning, this can influence how people bet, leading sportsbooks to adjust their lines accordingly.

Point spread odds can and do change based on a combination of actual betting patterns, unexpected events, and shifts in public perception. Savvy bettors keep a close eye on these line moves, as they can offer insights into where the value lies in a particular bet.

Point spread betting outcomes

When placing a point spread wager, there are a few potential outcomes:

The favorite can cover the spread by winning by a margin greater than the specified point spread

The underdog can either win the game outright or lose by fewer points than the spread, thereby "covering" the spread themselves

There's the possibility of a "push," where the difference in the game's score exactly matches the point spread, resulting in the return of the original bet to all bettors

How to win a point spread bet

Suppose an NBA betting site has set the point spread for a Los Angeles Lakers-New York Knicks game at the Lakers -7.

This means the Lakers are the favorites and are expected to win by 7 points.

If you place a spread wager on the Lakers, to win your bet, the Lakers must win the game by more than 7 points.

Let's say the final score is Lakers 110, Knicks 100. The Lakers won by a margin of 10 points. Since this is more than the 7-point spread, if you bet on the Lakers, you would win your wager.

How you lose a point spread bet

Say an NFL betting site has set the point spread for a Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game at the Bears -4. This indicates that the Bears are the favorites and are expected to win by 4 points.

If you make a spread bet on the Bears, you're betting they'll win by more than 4 points.

However, let's assume the final score turns out to be Chicago Bears 24, Miami Dolphins 23. In this scenario, the Bears have won the game by only a 1-point margin.

Since this is less than the 4-point spread, if you had the Bears, you would lose your wager. Despite the Bears winning the game, they failed to "cover" the 4-point spread, leading to a loss for those who wagered on them.

What is a push in a spread bet?

A "push" in betting refers to a situation where the final result of an event matches the set point spread, resulting in neither a win nor a loss for bettors. When a push occurs, the wagers are typically refunded.

For instance, let's consider an NFL game where the Dallas Cowboys are favored by 7 points against the Philadelphia Eagles.

If the game ends with the Cowboys winning by exactly 7 points, those who bet on either team experience a push. Their wagers would be refunded as the Cowboys neither exceeded nor fell short of the 7-point spread.

Sportsbooks often employ half-points in their lines to avoid this scenario. (They don’t want to return bets.) For example, if our point spread was Cowboys -7.5, the game could not possibly end in a push.

Point spread betting by sport

Spread betting is popular across sports, but there can be slight differences. Let’s break it down.

Point spread odds in football

Say a hypothetical NFL point spread for the Patriots and Steelers has the Patriots as -5.5 favorites. If you bet on the Pats, they must win by 6 or more points for a winning wager. Betting on the Steelers would win if they either win outright or lose by 5 or fewer points.

Point spread odds in basketball

Say an NBA point spread has the Warriors as -9 favorites over the Raptors. To win a bet on the Warriors, they need to win by 10 or more points. Bets on the Raptors would win if they either win outright or lose by 8 or fewer points.

If the score is Warriors 110, Raptors 104, Raptors bets win since they lost by only 6 points. A 115-104 Warriors win would mean they covered the spread by 11 points.

Point spread odds in baseball

In a hypothetical MLB matchup between the Yankees and the Red Sox, the Yankees are set as -1.5 favorites on the "run line" (baseball’s point spread). Betting on the Yankees requires them to win by 2 or more runs.

For Red Sox bets to win, they must either secure a victory or lose by just 1 run. If the score ends Yankees 5, Red Sox 4, Red Sox bets win. Conversely, a 6-3 win for the Yankees covers the run line with a 3-run margin.

Point spread odds in hockey

At NHL betting sites, the "puck line" is akin to the point spread. In a game between the Canadiens and the Blackhawks, with the Canadiens as -1.5 favorites, they'd need to win by 2+ goals for their bettors to win.

Blackhawks bets win if they either triumph outright or lose by only one goal. If the score is Canadiens 3, Blackhawks 2, Blackhawks bets win since the Canadiens' one-goal victory doesn't cover the 1.5-goal spread. A 4-1 win for the Canadiens would mean they covered the spread by a 3-goal margin.

Point spread odds in soccer

In a hypothetical MLS game between LA Galaxy and Atlanta United, LA Galaxy is set as a -1 favorite on the goal line. They'd need to win by 2+ goals for bets on them to succeed. Atlanta United bets win if they either triumph outright or lose by a single goal.

With a score of LA Galaxy 2, Atlanta United 1, Atlanta bets win. However, a 3-1 win for LA Galaxy covers the spread with a 2-goal victory margin.

Point spread odds in tennis

At tennis betting sites, point spread betting is usually based on games or sets, termed "game handicap" or "set handicap." In a match between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, if Williams is a -4.5 favorite, she must win by a 5-game margin for her bettors to win.

For example, a match score of 6-4, 6-2 for Williams gives a 6-game margin, covering the -4.5 spread. Betting on Sharapova at +4.5 wins if she wins outright or Williams wins by fewer than 5 games. Set handicaps work similarly but focus on the number of sets won by each player.

Point spread odds in golf

In golf betting, betting often centers on outright winners or head-to-head matchups. However, there's also "stroke handicap" betting, akin to point spreads but with golf strokes.

For example, in a head-to-head bet between Tiger Woods and Jordan Spieth, if Woods is given a -2.5 stroke handicap as the favorite, he'd need to outplay Spieth by 3 strokes or more to win the bet.

Betting on Spieth at +2.5 means he either wins outright or Woods wins by just 1 or 2 strokes.

Point spread betting FAQ

How does point spread betting work?

Point spread betting is a form of wagering where a sportsbook assigns a "spread" to level the playing field between two teams. One team, deemed the favorite, will have points deducted, while the other team, the underdog, will have points added.

The favorite must win by more than the spread to "cover" and be considered a winning bet, while the underdog must either win outright or lose by fewer points than the spread to be a winning bet.

What does the (-) in point spread betting mean?

The "(-)" symbol denotes the favorite and indicates by how many points the favorite must win to "cover" the spread.

What does the (+) in point spread betting mean?

The "(+)" symbol denotes the underdog and indicates the additional points given to that team for the purposes of the bet.

What happens to my point spread bet if there’s a tie?

If a point spread bet results in a tie, also known as a "push," most sportsbooks will refund the amount wagered. This means neither the bettor nor the sportsbook wins or loses money on that particular bet. To avoid pushes, sportsbooks often use half-points (like 7.5 or 6.5) in their spreads.

Looking at this question a different way, if there’s a tie in the literal matchup, many spread bets should still have winners and losers. Say the Cleveland Browns are -1.5 favorites over the Baltimore Ravens, but this NFL matchup ends in a 21-21 tie after overtime. The Ravens would win that spread bet because the margin of victory (0) was narrower than 1.5.
