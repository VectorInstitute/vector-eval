MLB's winter meetings are always a prime time for moves to happen as many of the top executives, players and agents all come together at the same spot.

Last year's winter meetings wound up being explosive. Aaron Judge, Justin Verlander, Trea Turner and Xander Bogaerts all came away with new contracts.

This year's winter meetings could wind up being similarly busy. There is a growing sense Shohei Ohtani could sign during the winter meetings, and a move of that magnitude could kick off the next wave of moves. There's also a number of top players on the trade market, including star Padres outfielder Juan Soto.

Starting Sunday, Dec. 3, and running through Wednesday, Dec. 6, expect MLB's offseason to really kick into high gear.

Shohei Ohtani field growing smaller

It has been expected since before he hit free agency that Ohtani would set the record for the largest fully guaranteed contract in North American sports history, with Passan reporting the deal could reach as much as $600 million.

Who will hand him that contract has been much more of a mystery. Little has been leaked about the top suitors for Ohtani beyond the usual suspects. Passan reported that at least three teams initially believed to be in the running â€” the Mets, Rangers and Red Sox â€” are believed to be out now. The teams most likely to still be in the mix are the Dodgers, Cubs, Blue Jays and Angels, with the Giants' status in the race for Ohtani unknown.

Star players could be traded

Date: Friday, Dec. 1

The free agency pool outside of Ohtani, Cody Bellinger, Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto is a bit lacking in star power, but the trade market could ensure several big-name players are on the move this offseason.

Passan reported a trade of Soto appears to be "edging closer to becoming a reality," and while several teams are out on him because of his large salary and pending free-agent status, there still could be a large market for the star outfielder.

Much of the rest of the names on the trade market are arms. Dylan Cease and Tyler Glasnow are the pitchers most likely to be dealt this offseason, and Cleveland could also hold a pair of intriguing trade chips in closer Emmanuel Clase and former Cy Young winner Shane Bieber. The Brewers have also begun trade talks for former Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes.
