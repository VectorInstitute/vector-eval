The Christmas Eve showdown between the Patriots and the Broncos was expected to be a solid victory by Denver against a team that had won just three games heading into the contest. It was anything but that.

In a game that it had it all between critical turnovers and scores that came down to the final minute, Patriots kicker Chad Ryland hit a 56-yard field goal to send the Patriots to a 26-23 victory.

Coming into this game, New England had played the Chiefs tough but lost at home to fall to 3-11 and improve its chances of landing the No. 1 pick in next year's draft. Denver aimed to get back to the right side of the win column after getting blown out by the Lions in an all-around abysmal performance.

In this one, it took the Broncos a while once more to put points on the board, with 16 of them coming in the fourth quarter in a comeback effort that proved just a hit too late.

Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson had seemed to be experiencing a bit of a resurgence in his first year playing under head coach Sean Payton, but there have continued to be some ups and downs. Wilson finished out this one 25-of-37 for 238 yards with two touchdowns.

He faced a Patriots defense that is among the better ones in the league, hardly like its offense has been for the better part of the year. The offense ranked 28th in the league heading into the game. However, the Patriots had one of their better showings on that side of the ball as they totaled 289 yards with 23 points.

The Broncos' loss puts their playoff hopes on ice at 7-8, though Denver isn't formally eliminated quite yet. The Patriots moved to 4-11 but hurt their draft positioning in the process.
