The renaissance continues for Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield.

The veteran hurler has enjoyed quite the campaign in 2024, turning back the clock with ruthless efficiency while leading Tampa Bay to the top of the NFC South totem pole.

Mayfield has quietly emerged as one of the league's best passers this year, entering the Bucs' Week 15 matchup with the Packers with a hair under 3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns to just eight interceptions.

He kept the good times rolling on Sunday, shredding Joe Barry's Packers defense to keep the Bucs strumming along towards a divisional crown with a 34-20 win.

Mayfield completed 22 of 28 passes (78.6%) for 381 yards and four touchdowns to lead Tampa Bay to glory over its intra-conference rivals. It was the finest display of Mayfield's season and one of the best of his career. It's also one of the greatest showings in recent Lambeau Field history; according to ESPN Stats and Info, Mayfield is just the sixth opposing QB to toss for at least 350 yards and four touchdowns in a single game there.

Per @ESPNStatsInfo, Baker Mayfield is the sixth visiting QB throw for 350 yards and four TDs at Lambeau Field all time. Kirk Cousins (2018) was the last to do it. — Rob Demovsky (@RobDemovsky) December 17, 2023

Mayfield has shown off his arm talent in years past. He's hit the 300-yard mark on 12 separate occasions. He's also showcased inch-perfect precision, having completed at least 75% of his passes 10 other times.

He's rarely done so together, though. Nor has he provided such a viable scoring punch in those matchups: Sunday represents just the fourth time Mayfield has ever notched at least four touchdown throws.

It was just the sort of act that the Buccaneers were craving. And it means so much more for Mayfield, a player whose time in the spotlight looked to be waning just one year ago.

With that, let's take a closer examination of Mayfield's one shining moment against Green Bay.

Baker Mayfield stats today

In many ways, Mayfield's Week 15 masterpiece was one of the most impressive of his career. He turned the frozen tundra into a canvas, splattering all sorts of different colors on it while taking brief respites to admire his work. Mayfield finished the day with 381 passing yards, four passing scores and a 78.6% completion percentage.

In terms of individual days, it was a career one for Mayfield. He recorded the second-most single-game yard and second-most single-game touchdown totals of his professional career. And he did all this against a side fighting tooth and nail with Tampa for a playoff spot.

Mayfield did the brunt of his damage against zone coverage, whipping arrows beyond the Packers secondary time and time again. Per Next Gen Stats, Mayfield was 20-of-24 for 361 yards and three touchdowns against zone.

He also became the first player in seven years to complete a touchdown pass in all four levels of the field (line of scrimmage, 1-10 yards, 11-20 yards, 20+ yards).

Baker Mayfield completed 20 of 24 passes against zone coverage for 361 yards & 3 TD in the Buccaneers 34-20 victory over the Packers.

The film told a similar story. Mayfield looked composed in the pocket, letting loose as he slung the hazel-tinted chamber in all sorts of different directions. He hit that much-vaunted 158.3 perfect passer rating, becoming the first visiting quarterback to ever record such a mark at Lambeau. And he did so in style, whipping whistlers beyond Green Bay surveillance with a variety of targets. Five different Buccaneers wide receivers recorded at least 40 receiving yards on the day.

Chris Godwin was Mayfield's favorite battery mate. He caught 10 passes for 155 yards, by far his best showing of the year. But even when Godwin wasn't open, Mayfield got creative. Whether it was Mike Evans, Rachaad White, David Moore or even Ko Kieft, it seemed that whenever Mayfield wanted someone to get the ball, he got it to them without a hint of discomfort.

Perfect day in Green Bay for Baker Mayfield.

He sparkled at the league's most hallowed ground. And in the process, he made a bit of league history. Mayfield is one of just three QBs to throw for 375+ yards and four touchdown passes while recording a perfect passer rating away from home. The other two? Nick Foles in 2014 and Ken O'Brien in 1986.

In today's @Buccaneers win, @bakermayfield became the 3rd QB in @NFL history with 375+ passing yards (381), 4+ TD passes (4) & a 158.3 passer rating - the highest attainable mark - in a road game.

Not bad for an undersized sidewinder who looked to be approaching the end of his rope as a starting QB one year prior.

You can't get better than perfect. And Mayfield was about as close to it as any QB has been in a road matchup.
