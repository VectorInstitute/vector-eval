Folks, the Bengals are back.

When Cincinnati began the season 1-3, including a pair of blowout losses in which they scored just three points in each game against the Browns and Titans, it sure seemed Joe Burrow's calf injury would wind up holding the team back in what appeared to be one of their best chances to finally win that elusive Super Bowl.

Since that loss to Tennessee, it's been the Bengals of old. And that team showed up again on "Sunday Night Football" against the Bills. Cincinnati jumped out to an first-half, 21-7 lead against Buffalo, and the defense did the rest, limiting the Bills to just 11 points the rest of the game as the Bengals won their fourth straight, beating the Bills 24-18.

Fans expected this to be an offensive showdown against two premier quarterbacks. And after the first three drives of the game, it sure appeared that's how it would go. The Bengals scored an opening-drive touchdown on just nine plays, matched quickly by a Bills' scoring drive of seven plays and 3:15. The Bengals re-took the lead on a 5:28 scoring drive to wrap up the first.

From there, however, "Mad Scientist" Lou Anarumo's defense kept Josh Allen and the Bills off balance offensively for most of the remainder of the game. The next four drives of the half went punt, interception, punt, end of half.

Burrow and the Bengals, meanwhile, hit a few bumps in Buffalo territory, but scored a touchdown on their final drive of of the first half to take a two-score lead into the locker room. Buffalo picked up a field goal on the first drive of the second half and held the Bengals to just three points in the second half, but it wasn't until 3:32 left that Allen finally got the Bills back into the end zone, with a 17-yard strike to Diggs and a subsequent 2-point try to make it a six-point game.

The Bengals had the ball back with 3:32 left, but put the trust in No. 9, having him start the put-away drive with a 32-yard deep shot to Tyler Boyd to put the Bengals quickly in Buffalo territory. Joe Mixon ran three times to pick up the final first down needed to allow Burrow to kneel out the contest.

In a highly anticipated rematch between Allen and Burrow, it was the Bengals' signal-caller that once again came out the better in both the win column and the statsheet. Burrow completed 31-of-44 passes for 348 yards with a pair of touchdowns, while Allen went 26-for-38 with 258 passing yards, one passing touchdown and an interception. He also rushed eight times for 44 yards and another score.

With the win, the Bengals move into the final wild-card spot behind the Steelers and Browns, while the Bills are bumped down to the outside-looking-in of the AFC playoff race.
