The Rangers continue to be unstoppable road warriors.

Texas picked up its ninth consecutive road victory in these playoffs after defeating the Diamondbacks in Game 3 of the World Series, 3-1.

The Rangers were powered by some two-out magic in the third inning, as Marcus Semien finally found his bat with an RBI single before Corey Seager demolished a two-run home run 421 feet to right field.

Jon Gray got credited with the win after Max Scherzer was pulled from the contest with a lower back injury through three scoreless innings. Gray was fantastic in a surprise relief appearance, throwing three scoreless innings with three strikeouts and just one hit allowed.

The Diamondbacks' offense struggled to string together hits and couldn't cash in when they had runners in scoring position. Even though they out-hit the Rangers, Arizona's bats hardly put any pressure on Texas' pitching.

10:51 p.m.: Bottom of 9th ‚Äî Gabriel Moreno thought he had a lead-off walk but the home plate umpire saw it as a strike even though it was off the plate. Moreno grounded out to third on the next pitch. A tough break for the Diamondbacks.

10:49 p.m.: Bottom of 9th ‚Äî Rangers closer Jos√© Leclerc is in to try and secure the save.

10:46 p.m.: Top of 9th ‚Äî Nathaniel Lowe hit a comebacker at Andrew Saalfrank but the ball ricocheted right to Ketel Marte who pitched it to Christian Walker to end the inning.

10:44 p.m.: Top of 9th ‚Äî Jonah Heim struck out swinging and with two outs, that'll do it for Luis Frias. LHP Andrew Saalfrank will come in to face LHH Nathaniel Lowe to try and close out the inning.

10:39 p.m.: Top of 9th ‚Äî Mitch Garver flew out to center and the Diamondbacks almost caught Evan Carter slipping, nearly doubling up the rookie at first. Arizona challenged to see if Carter touched second base on his way back but the challenge was unsuccessful.

Eighth inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 1

10:30 p.m.: Bottom of 8th ‚Äî Aroldis Chapman gets Corbin Carroll to strike out looking, freezing the star rookie on a filthy slider.

10:26 p.m.: Bottom of 8th ‚Äî Geraldo Perdomo drives in Emmanuel Rivera! The No. 8 and 9 spots in Arizona's lineup deliver as Perdomo rips an RBI single into left. Here comes the top of the order with no outs. Rangers lead 3-1.

10:25 p.m.: Bottom of 8th ‚Äî The pinch-hit decision pays off as Emmanuel Rivera drives a double down the line in right. Let's see if the Diamondbacks can finally cash in.

10:20 p.m.: Bottom of 8th ‚Äî LHP Aroldis Chapman is coming in for Josh Sborz. The Diamondbacks were going to pinch-hit LHH Pavin Smith for Evan Longoria but once the Rangers elected to bring in Chapman, Arizona pivoted to RHH Emmanuel Rivera.

10:19 p.m.: Bottom of 8th ‚Äî Adolis Garcia is leaving the game with an oblique injury. Travis Janowski will take his place in right field.

10:15 p.m.: Top of 8th ‚Äî Luis Frias does his job, sending down the Rangers' top of the order with ease. Marcus Semien grounded out to second, Corey Seager struck out swinging and Adolis Garcia flew out to center. Something to monitor: Garcia came up holding his left side after the swing that ended the inning.

10:00 p.m.: Bottom of 7th ‚Äî Jon Gray was rolling, but Bruce Bochy will elect to turn to RHP Josh Sborz for the bottom of the 7th. Gray was fantastic in a surprise relief appearance, delivering three scoreless innings with three K's and just one hit allowed.

9:58 p.m.: Top of 7th ‚Äî Kyle Nelson sends the Rangers down in order. Nathaniel Lowe took him deep to the warning track but Lourdes Gurriel Jr. was there to track it down. Josh Jung grounded out to short and Leody Tavares grounded out to third.

9:53 p.m.: Top of 7th ‚Äî LHP Kyle Nelson will enter the game for Miguel Castro with a couple of lefties, Nathaniel Lowe and Josh Jung, coming to the plate to start the inning.

9:49 p.m.: Bottom of 6th ‚Äî The Diamondbacks picked up just their third hit of the game on a two-out Ketel Marte single on a line drive off of Marcus Semien's glove, but they failed to make any noise.

Fifth inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0

9:28 p.m.: Bottom of 5th ‚Äî Jon Gray is cruising. Despite an impromptu appearance, the Rangers pitcher has sent down the first six batters he has faced. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and Alek Thomas both grounded out and Evan Longoria popped out to first in foul play.

9:19 p.m.: Top of 5th ‚Äî Brandon Pfaadt survives a lead-off walk to Nathaniel Lowe unscathed. He struck out Josh Jung, then Leody Tavares lined out to third and Marcus Semien grounded out to third to end the inning.

9:07 p.m.: Bottom of 4th ‚Äî Jon Gray didn't need much time to settle in. He struck out Gabriel Moreno, Christian Walker grounded out to third and Tommy Pham flew out to center for an easy 1-2-3 inning.

9:03 p.m.: Bottom of 4th ‚Äî An interesting development: Max Scherzer is being pulled from the game after just 36 pitches and three scoreless innings. Scherzer tried to take the mound for the bottom of the fourth but it appears he is being bothered by a lower back injury. It is unknown if the injury is correlated to the comebacker he took off of his lower back in the second inning. RHP Jon Gray will get the ball.

8:51 p.m.: Bottom of 3rd ‚Äî Max Scherzer assures the Diamondbacks don't answer right away, getting through the bottom of the 3rd with little resistance.

Carroll advanced to second on a wild pitch, but Scherzer got Ketel Marte to fly out to left to end the frame.

8:45 p.m.: Top of 3rd ‚Äî Brandon Pfaadt got Adolis Garcia to strike out swinging to end the inning. The damage was limited to three runs.

Second inning: Rangers 0, Diamondbacks 0

8:27 p.m.: Bottom of 2nd ‚Äî Adolis Garcia on the defensive end! Tommy Pham singled to right field and Christian Walker tried to score from second, but Garcia ‚Äî who has one of the best outfield arms in baseball ‚Äî hosed him at home plate to save a run. Pham advanced to second on the throw.

8:22 p.m.: Top of 2nd ‚Äî Rangers star rookie Evan Carter led off the top of the second with a hard-hit single to right center, but Mitch Garver topped a grounder to Brandon Pfaadt for a 1-4-3 double play. Jonah Heim flew out to center to end the inning. Pfaadt has only needed 18 pitches to get through his first six batters.

First inning: Rangers 0, Diamondbacks 0

8:15 p.m.: Bottom of 1st ‚Äî Max Scherzer got Corbin Carroll to ground out to short, but he walked Ketel Marte to give the Diamondbacks the first baserunner of the game.

8:08 p.m.: Top of 1st ‚Äî Brandon Pfaadt breezes through the top of the Rangers' order with ease. Marcus Semien popped out to right, Corey Seager grounded out to first base on a first-pitch sinker and Adolis Garcia flew out to center. Pfaadt only needed 10 pitches to get through the top of the first.

Pregame

3:29 p.m.: After only scoring one run in Game 2, the Rangers will make a slight tweak to the lineup. Adolis Garcia will slide up to the No. 3 spot, with Evan Carter hitting clean-up. As Texas PR mentioned, Carter is the fifth-youngest player in World Series history to bat fourth, joining Juan Soto, Ty Cobb, Miguel Cabrera and Claudell Washington.

RHP Max Scherzer will get the start.

3:10 p.m.: The Diamondbacks will have Corbin Carroll return to the top of the lineup after leading off with Ketel Marte in Game 2. RHP Brandon Pfaadt will get the ball to start.
