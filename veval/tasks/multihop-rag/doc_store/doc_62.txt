The primary draw of the moneyline bet lies in its simplicity. Even those just dipping their toes into the world of sports betting for the first time can quickly get a handle on the basics of the moneyline.

On this page we'll unpack the ins and outs of moneyline betting in more detail.

What is a moneyline bet?

So, what's the essence of a moneyline bet? In this type of bet, the sole focus is identifying the winner.

The victory margin and the total points scored have no bearing. It doesn't matter if your chosen team clinches a win with a score of 2-1 or a blowout of 50-0; the payout remains unchanged.

In this way, the moneyline distills sports to their essence: cheering for a victor.

Every moneyline bet has a favorite and an underdog as determined by the sportsbook. In the context of moneyline betting, "favorites" and "underdogs" refer to the perceived stronger and weaker participants, respectively.

Favorites:

The favorite is the participant (be it a team or an individual) who is expected to win the event or matchup.

In moneyline odds, especially in American odds format, the favorite is usually represented with a minus (-) sign. For instance, if Team A is a favorite and is listed at -150, a bettor would need to wager $150 to win $100.

Underdogs:

The underdog is the participant deemed less likely to win compared to the opponent.

Underdogs in moneyline odds, particularly in the American odds format, are usually represented with a plus (+) sign. If Team B is an underdog and has odds of +130, a bettor would win $130 for every $100 they bet, should Team B win.

Moneyline odds formats

You'll typically encounter three types of odds when researching and handicapping across various platforms—decimal, fractional, and American.

Most listings on the best online sports betting sites predominantly use American Odds.

American Odds

You'll usually see these displayed as either a negative (-) or positive (+) number, symbolizing different implications in the betting world.

The negative numbers might seem a bit perplexing at first. They point to the team, player, or option considered the favorite to win.

This number can also represent wagers that are less than even money. Essentially, the negative figure tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit of $100. We'll clarify with an example shortly.

Conversely, positive odds signal the underdog in the betting scenario or bets that offer more than even money. This figure shows how much profit you'll make on a $100 wager.

To illustrate with a moneyline bet: Imagine on a top NFL betting site the New England Patriots are listed as -110 favorites, while the New York Jets stand at +250.

You decide to back the favorite and bet $110 on the Pats. The Pats win, and you end up with $210.

That sum comprises your initial $110 bet and the $100 profit you've earned.

Fractional Odds

While you might occasionally encounter these odds, especially in contexts like horse racing, they're quite straightforward once you get the hang of them, even if they initially seem like a math problem.

These odds typically look like two numbers separated by a slash (/) or a dash (-), resembling a fraction. For instance, you might see 5/1 or 5-1.

Here's a simple way to interpret fractions: the first number (akin to the numerator in math) represents potential profit, while the second (akin to the denominator) indicates the amount you need to stake.

In other words, the denominator tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit equivalent to the numerator.

For example, with 2/1 odds, you'd earn $2 for every $1 you wager. Conversely, with 4/9 odds, a bet of $9 would yield a $4 profit.

To further illustrate, if you placed a bet of $9 at 4/9 odds and won, you'd receive $13 in total: your initial $9 stake plus the $4 profit.

Decimal Odds

Decimals are to betting what the metric system is to measurements: straightforward and user-friendly. They present fewer intricacies compared to their American and fractional counterparts.

However, just as the metric system is not universally embraced in the US, decimal odds can also be overlooked there.

Fortunately, working with decimal odds is simple. To determine a bet's payout, you multiply the decimal odds by the amount you're betting.

For instance, if the odds on an NHL betting site have the Edmonton Oilers at 2.53 to beat the Detroit Red Wings, a $10 bet would yield a $25.30 return. This includes your initial $10 wager, along with a profit of $15.30.

It's essential to note that this calculation gives you the total payout, not just your earnings. If you're keen on tracking your profits from betting, remember to subtract your original stake from the payout to get an accurate figure.

Why do moneyline odds change?

Lines at the best sports betting apps change quickly due to two primary reasons:

Public betting

New information

Before setting odds for an event, oddsmakers gather extensive data. Once they finalize the odds, they release them to the public.

As a bettor, you can bet immediately or wait for potential shifts in the odds, although predicting these shifts is challenging.

For instance, when examining odds for the next Super Bowl champion released shortly after the previous Super Bowl, these odds are based mostly on the recently concluded season.

As the new season approaches and teams make changes, odds adjust based on perceived championship chances. As games progress, lines continue to evolve based on team performances.

Public betting can also sway lines. If too many wagers favor one outcome, sportsbooks adjust the odds to balance the bets. This ensures an even distribution of bets and reduces the sportsbook's financial risk.

Moneyline betting outcomes

When you’re placing a moneyline wager, several outcomes are possible. The most straightforward outcome is a win or a loss, determined by whether the team or individual you bet on is victorious or defeated.

There's also the possibility of a draw, which occurs if the event ends in a tie.

Moneyline win

Winning a moneyline bet is very straightforward. All you need to do is pick the team or individual who is going to win an event and choose correctly.

If you bet on a boxing match between Boxer A and Boxer B, and you've bet on Boxer B to win and he does, then your bet would be successful and you'd get paid based on the odds at the time you placed your wager.

Moneyline loss

When placing a moneyline wager, a loss simply means that the team or individual you bet on did not win the event or matchup.

For example, let's say on an NBA betting site you bet on a basketball game between Team A and Team B. You believe Team A will win, so you place a $100 moneyline wager on them. If Team B wins, your bet on Team A would be a loss.

Draw

In some sports, notably soccer, games can end in a draw, and bettors have the option to wager on this outcome. When placing a moneyline wager in such situations, you'll typically see three sets of odds: one for each team to win and one for the game to end in a draw.

For instance, consider a soccer match between Team A and Team B. The moneyline odds might look something like this:

Team A: +150

+150 Draw: +220

+220 Team B: +180

If you believe the game will end in a tie, you could place a $100 wager on the "Draw" option. If the match indeed concludes with a tied score, you would win based on the +220 odds. This means you'd receive $220 in profit on top of your $100 stake, totaling $320. However, if either Team A or Team B wins, you'd lose your $100 wager.

It's important to note that in PGA and other golf tournaments, there are usually many players, so the odds can be much higher than in head-to-head sports matchups, given the broader field of competition.

Moneyline Betting FAQ

How do moneyline bets work?

Moneylines hinge on the outright winner of a game or event. They are presented with either a positive (+) or negative (-) sign:

A positive moneyline (+) indicates the underdog and represents the amount of profit on a $100 bet.

A negative moneyline (-) indicates the favorite and shows how much you need to bet to earn a $100 profit.

What happens if there’s a tie in a moneyline bet?

If there's a tie in a moneyline bet, it is typically referred to as a "push." When a push occurs, bettors are refunded their original wager. No money is won or lost. However, sports that typically have the possibility of a tie (like soccer) often provide bettors with the option to bet on a draw.

If the game ends in a draw and you haven't bet on that option, you would lose your bet. It's essential to understand the specific rules of the sportsbook and the sport you're betting on to know how ties are handled.

Does overtime count in my moneyline bet?

Yes, in most sports and with most sportsbooks (including new betting sites), overtime (or any extra time or tiebreakers) does count in a moneyline bet.

That said, always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you're using to ensure you understand their policies.

Why do moneyline odds change?

Moneyline odds change for several reasons.

Public Betting Patterns: If a significant amount of money is being placed on one team or participant, sportsbooks might adjust the odds to balance their liability. By making the odds less favorable for a heavily-bet team and more favorable for the less-bet team, they can encourage more even betting.
