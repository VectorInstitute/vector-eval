13 Dec 2023 02.36 GMT James Wallace That‚Äôs it from me this evening/morning. Time to haul myself out of the OBO armchair and skulk off for some kip. That was an intriguing game and sets up this T20I series nicely. A real statement has been laid down by Rovman Powell and his men, West Indies were up against it early doors with England crunching their way to 112-2 off the first ten overs but Jos Buttler‚Äôs side only managed to make 59 runs off the next ten, losing eight wickets along the way. A total of 171 was thirty or more shy of where England would have liked to have ended up and so it proved as West Indies peeled up their sleeves and showed how muscular their own batting card is ‚Äì the home side cleared the ropes fourteen times compared to England‚Äôs six. Andre Russell and Rovman Powell found the stands with ease at the business end of the match to get West Indies over the line with eleven balls remaining. We‚Äôll be back to cover the second match in Grenada on Thursday, do join us for that. Until then, thank you and goodnight.

13 Dec 2023 02.28 GMT Andre Russell is Player of the Match: In his first T20I in over two years he took 3-29 and smashed 29* off just 14 deliveries with the game in the balance. He seems very pleased to be back in maroon. Life is so funny. Since when I got selected for the West Indies two weeks ago I‚Äôve been dreaming of being man of the match.‚Äù



13 Dec 2023 02.09 GMT West Indies win by 4 wickets! Andre Russell smashes the winning runs off Sam Curran! A length ball is spanked over point for a one bounce four to give the home side the win, they go 1-0 up in the series.

Updated at 02.29 GMT

13 Dec 2023 02.07 GMT 18th over: West Indies 168-6 (Powell 31, Russell 25) Adil Rashid is recalled for his final over, can he turn the game back to England? Nope. ANDRE RUSSELL SMASHES THE RASHID GOOGLY CLEAN OUT OF THE GROUND! Huge SIX! The big man even allows himself a coy smile. He enjoyed that one. A dot the next ball is followed by a powerful drive all along the baize for four! Eleven in total off the over and West Indies now just need four runs.



13 Dec 2023 02.01 GMT 17th over: West Indies 157-6 (Powell 31, Russell 14) Tymal Mills is entrusted. Singles off the first two balls. Powell swipes a full ball into the deep to collect a couple. SIX! Mills goes short and Powell gets a mighty top edge for a maximum! Fortune favours the brave, the Windies skipper gave that everything and it could have gone anywhere. Mills sends one down the leg side ‚Äì wide ball. Pressure on the bowler here‚Ä¶ Shot! Short and wide from Mills and sent to the fence with Swiss clock timing by Powell. Sixteen off the over, looking terminal for Buttler and co. 15 needed from 18 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.55 GMT 16th over: West Indies 141-6 (Powell 26, Russell 4) Livingstone continues. Four singles off the first four balls keeps the pressure on the West Indies. HOLD THAT THOUGHT. Rovman Powell crunches consecutive sixes down the ground with a shrug and swagger to make it sixteen off the over. The scales tip once more, England need to do away with one or both of Powell and Russell ‚Äì there‚Äôs no way they don‚Äôt win this for West Indies if they are there at the end. 31 needed from 24 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.51 GMT 15th over: West Indies 125-6 (Powell 12, Russell 2) Andre Russell the man to face the hattrick ball‚Ä¶ Boo! A decent ball on the stumps is patted back by the big man. Drama in Barbados, Russell works for a couple. Ahmed takes his cap with a broad smile on his face ‚Äì he hasn‚Äôt had it all his own way but finishes with 3-39 from his set of four. Advantage England? 47 needed from 30 balls.

Updated at 01.54 GMT

13 Dec 2023 01.47 GMT WICKET! Shepherd c Curran b Rehan Ahmed 0 (West Indies 123-6) Rehan Ahmed on a hattrick! Buttler brings Curran into slip and Shepherd pokes a leggie to him off his very first ball. Great stuff from Rehan who has turned the game England‚Äôs way in the space of a minute.



13 Dec 2023 01.45 GMT WICKET! Shai Hope c Brook b Rehan Ahmed 36 (West Indies 123-5) Ahmed is bunted for SIX by Shai Hope but strikes with the next ball as Hope holes out!



13 Dec 2023 01.44 GMT 14th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Liam Livingstone instead of Rashid and he does well to keep it to singles, England trying to take this as deep as possible and hope West Indies fluff their lines at the death. West Indies need 55 from 36 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.41 GMT 13th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Rehan has two balls left to complete his over. The first ball is flayed for four by Powell behind point! Valuable runs for West Indies. Rehan‚Äôs final ball is a dot, defended by Powell into the off side. West Indies need 60 from 42 balls.

13 Dec 2023 01.30 GMT Simon Burnton is our man in Barbados and he sends good news! ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a 9.35pm restart. We haven‚Äôt lost any overs.‚Äù We should be underway in about eight minutes. I believe that 10.10pm local time is the cut off for the match ‚Äì that‚Äôll be 2.10am here in London town. Excuse me whilst I head to the kitchen to microdose some Kenco.



13 Dec 2023 01.14 GMT Promising news ‚Äì the rain seems to be tailing off and a rope is being dragged around the outfield to take off any excess water. I‚Äôll bring news as soon as it wafts over from Barbados to my sofa.



13 Dec 2023 01.00 GMT Rain stops play (West Indies 108-4 and require 64 runs off 44 balls) What‚Äôs all this then? Out of nowhere the heavens crack like an inky br√ªl√©e and rain starts to pour. The players scurry off as the covers are hauled on. Crucially ‚Äì West Indies are six runs ahead of the Duckworth Lewis Stern rate. IF the rain doesn‚Äôt abate ‚Äì and it looks heavy at the moment ‚Äì then the home side will take the spoils. 12.4 overs: West Indies 108-4 (Hope 27, Powell 6)

Updated at 01.09 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.58 GMT 12th over: West Indies 102-4 (Hope 26, Hetmyer 1) Just a single and the wicket off the over, Shai Hope can‚Äôt break the legspin shackles. Windies skipper Rovman Powell is the new man and Buttler cranks the pressure by inserting a slip.

Updated at 01.04 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.52 GMT WICKET! Hetmyer c Duckett b Rashid 1 (West Indies 101-4) Adil Rashid takes his 100th T20I wicket! A crucial one in the context of the game too ‚Äì the dangerous Hetmyer is sent on his way for just a single as England look to ramp up the pressure heading into the nub end of this match. Hetmyer danced out of his crease and got a good piece of the length ball but it flew flat and hard to Duckett on the midwicket sponge. And he does it on his 100th T20I appearance! üíØ#BBCCricket #WIvENG pic.twitter.com/LYhUBtNnUj ‚Äî Test Match Special (@bbctms) December 13, 2023

13 Dec 2023 00.49 GMT WICKET! Pooran c & b Rehan Ahmed 13 (West Indies 100-3) Rehan back into the attack after his first over was minced for n n n n nineteen. Got him! Pooran flicks back a full ball and Rehan takes a nifty catch tumbling away to his left. Shimron Hetymer is the new batter and he tucks a single into the leg side to open his account. The wicket has given Ahmed a confidence boost and he gets out of the over with three dots. 11th over: West Indies 101-3 (Hope 25, Hetmyer 1)



13 Dec 2023 00.43 GMT 10th over: West Indies 99-2 (Hope 25, Pooran 13) Rashid is given another after his excellent first over. The googly is spotted by Pooran and driven down the ground handsomely for SIX! A glide behind point bring a single, Hope returns the favour with a flick into the leg side. A short ball is panned into the deep by Pooran for a couple to end the over. Bon Jovi O‚Äôclock ‚Äì West Indies need 73 from 60. Time for a quick slurp for the players and a knuckle stretch for me. Is there anybody alive out there?!



13 Dec 2023 00.37 GMT 9th over: West Indies 87-2 (Hope 23, Pooran 3) Will the wickets slow the Windies as they did England? Rehan is replaced by Tymal Mills who starts with another wide. Rusty stuff so far from the southpaw seamer. That‚Äôs better ‚Äì a series of slower balls and back of the hand trickery restricts Pooran and Hope before the final ball is top edged over Buttler‚Äôs head for a one bounce four. West Indies need 85 from 66 balls.



13 Dec 2023 00.32 GMT WICKET! Kyle Mayers c Brook b Rashid 35 (West Indies 79-3) The sorcerer follows his apprentice and bags a wicket first ball! That‚Äôs Rashid‚Äôs 99th T20I wicket ‚Äì in truth it was a bit of a drag down but from the front of the hand so it skidded onto Mayers who didn‚Äôt time it and was caught by Brook in the deep. England needed that BIG TIME. A masterclass from Rashid in the rest of the over, Nicholas Pooran is the new man and his clip for one is the only run from the over. 8th over: West Indies 79-2 (Hope 19, Pooran 1)

Updated at 00.56 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.28 GMT 7th over: West Indies 78-1 (Mayers 35, Hope 19) Rehan to Kyle Mayers. First ball is dragged down and launched over the midwicket boundary for SIX. Pressure on the young leggie. What a shot! Mayers holds the pose as he lofts a supreme drive down the ground for SIX more. Brutal elegance. Rehan comes back well with two sharply turning leggies. Bosh! Shai Hope gets in on the act and smears a length ball over mid on for the third six of the over. It‚Äôs a learning curve for the tyro spinner but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less bruising.



13 Dec 2023 00.23 GMT 6th over: West Indies 59-1 (Mayers 22, Hope 13) Curran is called back, Mills granted just the one over for the time being. Two slower balls bring two soothing dots for England. A single each to Mayers and Hope. Curran does very well to get out of the over with just three runs conceded. Powerplay complete. How long till we see some spin from Rehan? Not long at all, he‚Äôs on for the next over.



13 Dec 2023 00.20 GMT 5th over: West Indies 56-1 (Mayers 20, Hope 12) Woakes continues, after five balls he‚Äôs gone for just three runs. Can he get out of the over cheaply? No ‚Äì A length ball is clubbed down the ground for SIX with a minimum of fuss by Shai Hope. West Indies have come out of the traps as well as England did, one over of the Powerplay left.



13 Dec 2023 00.16 GMT 4th over: West Indies 47-1 (Mayers 18, Hope 5) Tymal Mills comes onto bowl for England for the first time in eighteen months, he has plenty of T20 skills up his sleeve, can he showcase them here? Hmmm, a couple of wides slanted down the leg side isn‚Äôt the best of starts. Mills lets out a hearty groan at the second. Two full balls are worked for singles‚Ä¶ Kablammo! Mills to Mayers ‚Äì short ball ‚Äì pulled onto the roof for SIX! What a shot, new ball please! DROP! And it is Ben Duckett who shells it! It would have been even better than the first grab but the ball smashes into his palm as he leaps to his right and comes straight out. They stick or they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs all happening.



13 Dec 2023 00.10 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 36-1 (Mayers 10, Hope 4) Shai Hope is the new man and digs out a Woakes yorker and somehow manages to crunch it away down the ground for four. The replay of the Duckett catch is extremely enjoyable, Woakes owes him one for that as it was a poor ball outside off stump.



13 Dec 2023 00.07 GMT WICKET! Brandon King c Duckett b Woakes 22 (West Indies 32-1) Chris Woakes into the attack to replace the beleaguered Sam Curran. OH. MY. LORDY. Ben Duckett flies to his left at backward point to pull off a spectacular diving catch off a full blooded cut shot from King. Stunner!



13 Dec 2023 00.03 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 30-0 (King 21, Mayers 9) Will Jacks to bowl his workmanlike spin at the other end. Uh-Oh! He drops short and Kyle Mayers murders it, the ball lands on the roof of the stadium. That deserved everything it got. Mayers cuts for three behind point and then King skips jauntily out of his crease to skim the ball for four down the ground!



12 Dec 2023 23.59 GMT 1st over: West Indies 16-0 (King 16, Mayers) Brandon King gets the home side off to a blistering start, sending Sam Curran down the ground for four and swiping a brace of SIXES over mid-wicket. Game on!



12 Dec 2023 23.56 GMT No sooner have I sploshed some water on me teabag‚Ä¶ the players emerge. West Indies need 172 to win!



12 Dec 2023 23.48 GMT An innings of two halves for England From 77 for no loss to 171 all out with three balls to spare. England's recent white ball approach is a variable one yielding mixed...often frustrating results #WIvENG ‚Äî Aatif Nawaz (@AatifNawaz) December 12, 2023



12 Dec 2023 23.47 GMT Time to stick the kettle on and raid the fridge before West Indies start their chase. 3-19 for Andre Russell on his comeback for West Indies, balancing the attack perfectly.



Russell at his best adds so much to West Indies's side. With him at 7, and Holder, Shepherd and Hosein to follow, West Indies bat incredibly deep ‚Äî Tim Wigmore (@timwig) December 12, 2023

Updated at 23.48 GMT

12 Dec 2023 23.46 GMT England all out 171! Tymal Mills gets a gossamer thin edge through to Pooran and England are all out with three deliveries to spare! What a turnaround for West Indies who were staring down the barrel with England flying 77-0 after six overs.



12 Dec 2023 23.44 GMT WICKET! Rashid b Joseph 0 (England 170-9) Rashid goes to swipe Joseph in the final over and hacks the ball onto his timbers. England nine down‚Ä¶



12 Dec 2023 23.42 GMT WICKET! Ahmed c Powell b Russell 1 (England 169-8) Rehan Ahmed follows shortly after, trying to smear a length ball down the ground he can only find Powell lurking ten yards in from the sponge. Russell gets two in the over and finishes his spell and his first T20I in two years with figures of 3-19. Nicely done. 19th over: England 169-8 (Woakes 2, Rashid 0)



12 Dec 2023 23.37 GMT WICKET! Livingstone b Russell 27 (England 167-7) Livingstone chops a cutter from Russell onto his stumps!
