Take, for instance, the value of exclusivity. For the past five or so years entertainment companies have been focused on creating their own streaming platforms, which would be built around exclusive control of their original content, whether it was original new series or a sister studio’s Hollywood movies. But now that income is desired most, some streamers are once again willing to sell non-exclusive rights to others. In December, one of the best original shows on Paramount+, the compelling horror-laced drama Yellowjackets, will become available on Netflix (see below for my recommendation). Netflix gets a buzzy show the vast majority of its subscribers have never had access to, while Paramount+ earns a rights payment and broadens the audience for Yellowjackets, which has a third season commissioned. Streaming’s walls are crumbling. That said, there are still plenty of promising new shows and movies, most of them exclusive to their services, debuting in December. Whether you’re after an awards season blockbuster (Netflix’s Maestro) or an Australian comic-drama (Binge’s Strife), your watchlist should be well loaded. Netflix Bradley Cooper stars as legedary conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein in Maestro. Credit: Jason McDonald/Netflix My top Netflix recommendation is Maestro (December 20). Not since Warren Beatty in the late 1970s has a Hollywood leading man so completely – perhaps obsessively – given themselves over to filmmaking as Bradley Cooper. The credit he banked from starring in the Hangover comedies, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Sniper let Cooper co-write, direct and star in the 2018 hit A Star is Born. He now fills the same three positions in another movie about a tormented musician: the superstar American conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein. Cooper bristles at the term biopic, and instead the film focuses on Bernstein’s conducting, his nurturing marriage to Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan), and his parallel relationships with male lovers. There’s no Shallow to be found here, but Cooper appears to inhabit Bernstein across decades and the film is primed for the Academy Awards.

Also on Netflix: Few shows recently have cast a spell as intense as Yellowjackets (December 15), a now-and-then horror thriller about a group of deeply divided 40-something women forced to confront the grim but unspoken reality of how they endured 18 months marooned in the Canadian wilderness as teenagers. With Juliette Lewis, Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci among the survivors, the story is a mix of supernatural menace, black comedy, teenage adversity, and deeply expressed trauma. It’s coming to Netflix after two years on Paramount+ and it’s a can’t-look-away binge just waiting to happen. When the history of the high-concept Hollywood blockbuster is written, Zack Snyder’s name will be prominent – for better or worse. Snyder is responsible for 300, Man of Steel, and most of Justice League, and having come to Netflix for the tepid zombie heist movie Army of the Dead he’s doubling down with Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire (December 22). A two-part space opera – the sequel is scheduled for next April – that Snyder originally pitched as a Star Wars spin-off, it’s a Seven Samurai-influenced epic about a former soldier, Kora (Atomic Blonde’s Sofia Boutella), who recruits a group of mercenaries (Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou) to defend the farmers on a moon threatened by the galaxy’s authoritarian ruler. Digital science-fiction spectacle is a given, but can Snyder deliver genuine emotional stakes? November highlights: David Fincher hit the mark with his assured hitman drama The Killer, documentary Last Stop Larrimah was a fascinating outback mystery, Robbie Williams was a star telling his own story, but prestige drama All the Light We Cannot See fell short. Binge Opal (BeBe Bettencourt), Christine (Maria Angelico), Jeeet (Olivia Junkeer), Penny (Bryony Skillington) and Evelyn (Asher Keddie) in Strife. Credit: Binge My top Binge recommendation is Strife (December 6). It’s not a direct adaptation, but this new Australian comic-drama about a woman trying to keep up with her own life is based on Mia Freedman’s 2017 memoir, Work Strife Balance. Asher Keddie, who has previously summed up the conflicting demands on professional women in Offspring and Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo, plays the fictional Evelyn Jones, a blogger who strikes a chord and becomes an online publisher and media commentator just as her marriage is coming apart. Evelyn keeps getting pulled in every direction, a situation that should be both comically rich and smartly telling in the hands of the show’s creator, Sarah Scheller, who previously put together the terrific motherhood comedy The Letdown (currently on Netflix). The supporting cast includes Matt Day (Rake) and Jonathan LaPaglia (The Slap).

Also on Binge: I won’t spoil it, but there was a nerve-shredding cliffhanger in the first season of Vigil (December 11) that I still think about far too often. That’s a pretty strong indicator that this Scottish crime thriller, where a police detective was assigned to a murder investigation on board an on-duty British nuclear submarine, pushed the right buttons. The show’s second season stays on dry land but retains the military focus: when an attack drone demonstration at a British army base goes tragically wrong, Detective Chief Inspector Amy Silva (Suranne Jones, Gentleman Jack) and her now pregnant partner, Detective Sergeant Kirsten Longacre (Rose Leslie, Game of Thrones), are called in to investigate. Expect a fast pace and significant twists – this series doesn’t do quiet contemplation. November highlights: Comedy troupe Please Don’t Destroy flew the flag for 20-somethings with The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, picaresque comedy Bookie made the right bet, and Julia continued the celebrity chef biography of Julia Child. Stan* Claudia Karvan and Nathalie Morris in the new season of Bump. Credit: Stan My top Stan recommendation is Bump (December 26). It’s one of the best new traditions in Australian television: a new season of this tremendous Sydney-based comic-drama gets uploaded every Boxing Day. This is the fourth instalment of Kelsey Munro and Claudia Karvan’s show and one of the strong points about it is that each iteration places its ensemble cast in a testing new light. The high-school students of season one, Oly (Nathalie Morris) and Santi (Carlos Sanson Jr), who were thrown together when a hook-up turned into a teenage pregnancy, are now a career woman and stay-at-home dad while their daughter, Jacinda (Ava Cannon), is in primary school. Bump tugs at the heartstrings, but with hard-earned understanding and a feel for the contrary demands of family. Please keep it coming. Also on Stan: Revealed: Ben Roberts-Smith Truth on Trial (December 10) is a feature-length documentary that provides the inside story to one of Australia’s most contentious and headline-making pieces of investigative journalism: the five-year quest to unearth the truth behind rumours that the country’s most decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, committed war crimes in Afghanistan. With stories in The Age and Sydney Morning Herald, as well as on 60 Minutes, journalists Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters pushed to bring the truth to the public, navigating divisions in the SAS and eventually the defamation trial that Roberts-Smith brought to court and lost. It’s been a compelling saga, and Dora Weekley’s documentary should include hitherto unknown details and unheard commentary.

I still haven’t got over the nightmarish sounds of a spinal surgery going very wrong in the first season, but nonetheless Dr Death (December 22) is back for a second serve of malpractice and monstrous medical egos. This American true crime drama is now an anthology. Every season is a different doctor whose abuse of privilege posed a criminal risk to their patients. The new season will cover Paolo Macchiarini, an Italian surgeon and researcher who was accused of laboratory fraud and manipulative behaviour. Fresh from Wolf Like Me, Edgar Ramirez plays Macchiarini, while Mandy Moore (This is Us) is Benita Alexander, the journalist who got dangerously close to the truth. November highlights: The final season of groundbreaking Canadian comedy Sort Of confirmed it as an under-the-radar gem, Scrublands was a tight Australian crime thriller, and science-fiction fans got a spin-off with Orphan Black: Echoes. Amazon Prime Alan Ritchson returns in Reacher. Credit: Amazon Prime My top Amazon Prime recommendation is Reacher (December 15). I am much heartened by the star of this American action series, Alan Ritchson, who decided that, despite looking like an absolute unit in the show’s first season, he nonetheless needed to add even more muscle for these new episodes to convincingly depict Jack Reacher. Adapted from Lee Child’s wildly successful novels about an off-the-grid former US military policeman – somehow the diminutive Tom Cruise played the role in a pair of movies – Reacher is an uncomplicated guy: he fixes wrongs with two fists and zero concerns. If anything, the first season was too subtle, so an even larger Reacher who drops deadpan one-liners while having access to a missile launcher seems promising. And I’m taking the under for the proposition of whether a ripped Reacher sheds his shirt within three episodes. Also on Amazon Prime: Recommending Prisoner’s Daughter (December 5) is a bet on talent. This domestic drama has a familiar outline, with an ageing and terminally ill criminal having his sentence commuted on the grounds that he lives with his estranged daughter, a single mother and Las Vegas waitress struggling to make ends meet and connect her son with a positive role model. Obviously, they’re going to belatedly bond in the face of increasingly fraught difficulties, but how that plays out will be guided by the performances of Brian Cox (Succession) and Kate Beckinsale (Laurel Canyon) as father and daughter, and the direction of Catherine Hardwicke, who found something genuine in the first Twilight movie before being replaced for the sequels by a succession of ill-equipped male filmmakers.

November highlights: The adult animated superhero drama Invincible returned with more cape fear, while the Bond franchise authorised a reality competition with 007: Road to a Million. Apple TV+ The Peanuts gang is back in The Snoopy Show - Happiness is Holiday Traditions. Credit: Apple TV+ My top Apple TV+ recommendation is The Snoopy Show: Happiness is Holiday Traditions (December 1). Just quietly, over the past two years Apple TV+ has been producing a nourishing stream of animated Snoopy content that is faithful to Charles M Schulz’s beloved comic strip, Peanuts. The spotted white beagle and his adolescent cohort – Charlie Brown, Marcie, Peppermint Patty, and many more – have always transferred easily from a panel on the page to an animation frame, and this official adaptation has a trademark mix of wry humour, flights of fantasy, and heartwarming camaraderie. Happiness is Holiday Traditions is a bonus special to close off the third season of the series, and it will stay true to the rule that helps make Peanuts endure: no adults are seen or heard. Also on Apple TV+: The trailer for Family Plan (December 15), an action-comedy feature where Mark Wahlberg plays a former master assassin who left the trade and secretly built a new life in the American suburbs as a cheerful husband and father, is goofy as all heck. The question is whether it’s ludicrous fun or just sappy shenanigans? Wahlberg’s Dan Morgan, who has to go on a Las Vegas road trip with his blissfully unaware family after his cover is blown, dispatching goons while carrying his youngest in a BabyBjorn and stunt driving in a family minivan are positive signs. Michelle Monaghan (True Detective) plays Mrs Morgan, who quietly thinks her husband is a little vanilla, and the fine Irish actor Ciaran Hinds (There Will Be Blood) goes full villain. November highlights: The Buccaneers placed a modern teen lens on Edith Wharton’s period marital drama, while Godzilla and pals returned for Monarchy: Legacy of Monsters and space race alternate history For All Mankind reached the 21st century.
