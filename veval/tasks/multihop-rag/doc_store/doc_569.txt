Colorado fans, you're back. For now.

A 43-yard pass from Shedeur Sanders on the Buffaloes' final drive helped set up Alejandro Mata for the game-winning 43-yard field goal with 12 seconds left, delivering Colorado the 27-24 win over Arizona State for their first Pac-12 win of the season. It snaps their eight-game conference losing streak.

Sanders had a mediocre day by his lofty standards, but his 239 yards and a touchdown were enough in perhaps Colorado's most crucial game so far. It brought the team to 4-2, but had it lost, it would have been much harder for the Buffs to finish the season bowl eligible. A win gives them a leg up in a competitive conference, particularly facing four ranked teams down the stretch of the season.

If Colorado wants to solidify a bowl game, it'll have to fix many things, one of them being the offensive line. It allowed five sacks on Sanders, bringing the season total to a nation-leading 31. The defense picked up five sacks themselves to maintain pressure on Trenton Bourguet.

For Arizona State, Bourguet put all he could into Saturday's narrow loss. He's one of two healthy quarterbacks on the roster, and passed for 335 yards and a touchdown. The Sun Devils had a real shot at their first conference win. But as the game came to a close, Bourguet seemed roughed up and slow, though he did drive the team down the field 94 yards in 13 plays for the game-tying touchdown with 50 seconds left.

Luckily for Arizona State, next week is a bye week. What's not so lucky is that it'll go on to play three ranked teams over the following three weeks.

We didn't see the worst of either team, though we didn't see the best either. Colorado needed a bounce back win and got one. Meanwhile Arizona State kept on struggling, falling to 1-5.
