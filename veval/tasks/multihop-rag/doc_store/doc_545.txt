It's somehow already mid-December, meaning millions of fantasy football owners just reached their respective "offseason." Luckily for those who missed the playoffs, there's Week 15 DFS. We hold the key to consistent daily fantasy success: pinpointing and playing the cheapest sleepers and highest-ceiling value plays each week.

Every Tuesday, we scour DraftKings, FanDuel, and SuperDraft for affordable sleepers and under-the-radar value plays that will set you apart from the DFS pack. By finding stud production at modest prices, we allow ourselves plenty of remaining budget to afford elite weekly performers at other roster spots. When our studs and our sleepers hit, we usually win.

We do all the leg work for you -- poring over the player pools, like my daughter searching the Target Christmas catalog — then we handpick the most promising sleepers and tell you why they're worth drafting to your next DFS squad. All you have to do is choose your favorites, sit back, and relax.

WEEK 15 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

If daily fantasy was as easy as picking all top-end skill-position players from one week to the next, it would be a lot easier to win the milli-maker. Let's face it, in order to win big, we need to hit on some diamonds in the rough, and in order to afford a CeeDee Lamb ($9,200 on DK), we have to invest in the occasional Demarcus Robinson ($3,600).

We have enjoyed consistent success with our DFS sleepers and values all season. Each Tuesday, we share a big list of our hits from the previous week. — with each hit typically netting at least 16-22 fantasy points. Throughout the year, we've been consistently ahead of the game on breakouts like Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams, and Tank Dell, among many others.

Take a look at our collection of hits from last week:

Pos. Player Wk. 14 Game DK Price Pts QB Baker Mayfield Buccaneers at Falcons $5,300 20.1 QB Russell Wilson Broncos at Chargers $5,800 19.5 QB Gardner Minshew Colts at Bengals $5,400 16.1 RB Joe Mixon Bengals vs. Colts $6,100 21.5 RB Javonte Williams Broncos at Chargers $5,800 18.1 WR Garrett Wilson Jets vs. Texans $5,500 23.1 WR Rashee Rice Chiefs vs. Bills $5,400 19.2 WR Courtland Sutton Broncos at Chargers $6,100 15.2 TE Isaiah Likely Ravens vs. Rams $3,500 19.3 DST Cleveland Browns vs. Jaguars $3,000 12.0

Now that's what we call a strong week! We averaged over 19 DK points per position player and 18.4 per position while spending just under $5,200 per pick. Rostering that kind of cheap production allowed us to find consistent weekly studs at other positions while setting us apart from the pack through lineup variance.

Let's shower, rinse, repeat! This year, we're also incorporating SuperDraft into our weekly DFS column. For those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. So, the sleepers who carry lower salaries in DK/FD have higher boosts on SD. The best part: SuperDraft users can roster any player with no restrictions.

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: QB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Brock Purdy, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $6,800 | FD: $8,400 | SD: 1.2x)

We usually don't feature players with salaries higher than $6,200 on DK and $8,000 on FD, but $6,800 on DK just seems like a massive value for the MVP frontrunner. Purdy has been scorching, with 57.9 DK points over San Francisco's past two games and at least 23.8 in five of the Niners' past six. The Cards rank among the 10 most generous defenses to QBs on DK, so we're all over the young gunslinger in the desert this weekend.

Jordan Love, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $6,200 | FD: $8,000 | SD: 1.25x)

Love and the Packers' pass-catchers have emerged as legit offensive threats over the past month, finally easing the Cheeseheads' anguish over the departure of Aaron Rodgers. Cult hero Tommy DeVito hit the pause button on Green Bay's good times, but it should start rolling again this weekend at home against a miserable Tampa Bay secondary. The Bucs have surrendered the fourth-most FD points and fifth-most DK points to QBs this season, and Plodmaster General AJ Dillon ain't about to crack their strong front-seven. We love Love this weekend, and not just because we're lovers at heart.

Other solid Week 15 values: Matthew Stafford, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.3x); Derek Carr, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Joe Flacco, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $5,500 | FD: $7,100 | SD: 1.35x); Will Levis, Titans vs. Texans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,800 | SD: 1.35x)

WEEK 15 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: RB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Devin Singletary, Texans at Titans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,000 | SD: 1.35x)

With C.J. Stroud in the league's concussion protocol and Nico Collins (calf) joining Tank Dell (fibula) on the Texans' injury list, Houston suddenly finds itself without many impact skill-position players. Singletary, however, has been pretty damn good and showed us last week that he's the main man over Dameon Pierce in DeMeco Ryans' backfield. He had 13 carries for 65 yards and a TD against the Jets, while Pierce totaled just five touches for seven yards. Don't be scared of Tennessee's run D because it ain't what it used to be under Mike Vrabel. Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane just posted 35.1 PPR points against the Titans, Chuba Hubbard had 20.2 a few weeks ago, and Rachaad White had 17.8 against them in Week 10.

Antonio Gibson, Commanders at Rams (DK: $5,200 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.4x)

Aaron Donald and friends will be attacking the pocket early and often in pursuit of Sam Howell, who has been sacked 10 more times than any other QB. Dump-offs and screens will be plentiful for Gibson, who comes at a major discount, at least in PPR formats.

More solid Week 15 RB values: Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $5,100 | FD: $5,500 | SD: 1.45x); Jordan Mason, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $4,600 | FD: $4,200 | SD: 1.6x); Tyler Allgeier, Falcons at Panthers (DK: $4,400 | FD: $5,700 | SD: 1.6x)

WEEK 15 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: WR sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Rashee Rice, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $6,100 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x)

With Isiah Pacheco (shoulder) banged up, Rice seems like Kansas City's best skill-position player this side of Travis Kelce. He's certainly the most sure-handed wideout on the Chiefs (not saying much, but still), and he has electric after-the-catch playmaking ability (which is good, considering Patrick Mahomes has struggled with deep-ball accuracy). The rookie has quietly posted 57.3 PPR points over the past three weeks! Since Bill Belichick's defense typically makes it a point to neutralize the opposition's top threat, which is obviously Kelce this weekend, look for Rice to bust some chunk-yard plays through the screen game and dump-downs.

Romeo Doubs, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $5,300 | FD: $6,400 | SD: 1.45x)

Doubs has been one of the more dependable offensive weapons in Green Bay's offense, and Tampa Bay's secondary has been utterly abysmal all season, so we're rolling with the young wideout in a handful of lineups this weekend. Doubs has a good floor, logging 11-plus DK points eight times, and a decent ceiling (at least 18.3 three times). Fire him up in what should be a pass-heavy matchup at Lambeau.

Demarcus Robinson, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,600 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.7x)

Robinson has become one of Matthew Stafford's most trusted receivers, drawing a 21.8-percent target share over the past two weeks. And the veteran has made the most of his opportunities, collecting seven catches for 101 yards and two TDs during that span. The Commanders are terrible at defending the pass — even worse than they were earlier in the season since they shipped out multiple impact pass-rushers. Washington has surrendered the most FanDuel points and second-most DraftKings points to wide receivers this season. Run DMC into your DFS lineups this weekend.

More solid Week 15 WR values: Amari Cooper, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.35x); Garrett Wilson, Jets at Dolphins (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,900 | SD: 1.4x); Brandin Cooks, Cowboys at Bills (DK: $5,200 | FD: $6,300 | SD: 1.45x); A.T. Perry, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $3,500 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.7x)

WEEK 15 DFS:

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: TE sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

David Njoku, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $4,700 | FD: $6,200 | SD: 1.3x)

Njoku went nuclear last weekend, catching six of his eight targets from Joe Flacco for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Now he gets a chance for an encore against the Bears, who have surrendered the 10th-most PPR points to tight ends this season. No joke, dude — you can trust Njoku!

More solid Week 15 TE values: Logan Thomas, Commanders at Rams (DK: $3,700 | FD: $5,100 | SD: 1.5x); Cade Otton, Buccaneers at Packers (DK: $3,200 | FD: $5,200 | SD: 1.65x); Tucker Kraft, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $3,000 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.8x)

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: D/ST sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel

Los Angeles Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,100 | FD: $4,300)

The Rams got destroyed by MVP candidate Lamar Jackson and the high-flying Ravens in Week 14, but push that out of your memory banks. Before that game, Sean McVay's squad had surrendered 20 or fewer points in four straight contests. Aaron Donald and company also have 17 sacks and six takeaways over their past six games, so they'll be licking their chops looking across the line at Sam Howell this weekend. No QB has more interceptions than Howell, who has also taken 10 more sacks than any other signal-caller this season.

More solid Week 15 D/ST plays: Chicago Bears at Browns (DK: $3,300 | FD: $4,100); New York Jets at Dolphins (DK: $2,700 | FD: $3,600); New England Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $2,300 | FD: $3,200)
