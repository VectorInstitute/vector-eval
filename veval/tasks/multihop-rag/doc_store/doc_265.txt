MLB live betting

The best sports betting apps offer live, in-game betting for Major League Baseball.

Live betting means you can bet on a game in progress, right down to what the next batter will do with the next pitch or what team will win the inning.

You’ll find live betting with top betting sites such as DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, and Caesars.

The key to live betting is using a betting app to make your wagers. Apps allow you to track all of the changes — both on the diamond and in the odds — as they happen. You won’t find that response time at a brick-and-mortar sportsbook.

Some common MLB in-game betting lines includes:

Next team to score

Run line and moneyline odds

Total runs scored

Winner of the next inning

Player props, such as total hits or strikeouts

Bet on MLB run lines, moneylines, and totals

Three of the most popular bet types for Major League Baseball games are run lines, moneylines, and totals. In case you’re not familiar, let’s explain all three.

A moneyline wager is as straightforward as they come. You’re betting on which team you believe is going to win the game. Each team is given odds by the sportsbook to indicate their perceived chances of winning. The underdog is represented by a positive (+) number, and the favorite is represented by a negative number (-).

Similar to a point spread in other sports, the run line bet gives the underdog a handicap of 1.5 runs in the game. The underdog needs to lose by one run or win outright for bets on them to be successful, while the favorite in the game needs to win by two runs or more to cover the spread.

Totals bets, also known as over/unders, focus on the combined number of runs both teams score. Oddsmakers assign a total number of runs, and bettors must decide if the two teams will score over or under that predicted total. The actual winner of the game doesn’t matter.

You’ll find these staple bet types at every online sportsbook that supports MLB betting.

How to bet First 5 Innings in MLB

For bettors who prefer to focus on the early portion of a Major League Baseball game, First 5 Innings or F5 bets are ideal. These bets concern the outcome of just the first five innings of a game, which often takes out the uncertainty of relief pitchers replacing the starters.

You’ll find the F5 bets in the MLB tab of your online sportsbook or MLB betting app, where you can browse the available odds and lines for those particular wagers. You can still place bets on moneylines, run lines, or totals—focused on only the first five innings of play.

Keep in mind that the odds and lines will likely be different than those for the full game since they are concentrated on the first half of the game only.

Best MLB props and futures

MLB props and futures allow you to bet on team and player performance irrespective of individual game outcomes. Some examples of popular MLB futures odds and proposition bets include:

World Series: You can bet on which team you believe will become the next World Series champion. You’ll find World Series futures odds for these nearly as soon as the previous World Series comes to an end, and they’ll change based on offseason moves, team news, team performance, and more.

Which player do you think will crank out the most homers during the regular season? Regular-season win totals: Make an over/under wager on a team based on the number of wins a sportsbook sets for them. Do you think your team will finish over that predicted win total, or will they come in under it?

Every sportsbook offers its own selection of futures and props bets, so shop around to find the sportsbooks that best fit your needs.

How to find the best MLB lines

It stands to reason that bettors always seek the most favorable MLB odds. “Line shopping” involves researching several different sportsbooks to compare odds.

This might involve using an odds feed, like the ones you’ll find here, or by comparing the odds on multiple online sportsbooks or MLB betting apps.

By doing this research, you’ll find the best odds for the bets you were already planning on making, which means you can maximize your potential return on your wager.

This can be a time-consuming process, but it also helps you boost your bankroll and give yourself the largest possible profit.

MLB betting rules at online sportsbooks

Every sportsbook has terms and conditions for all bets, MLB included. While those rules may be specific to each sportsbook, there are some general rules that should apply everywhere.

For example, MLB First 5 Innings bets are usually considered actionable after five innings of play, or 4.5 innings in the case of the home team having the lead.

Another rule many sportsbooks follow for baseball bets is weather-related, such as if a game is suspended due to rain or other weather conditions. These delays may lead to bets being refunded depending on the circumstances and the specific rules of your sportsbook.

Here are some other rules found at online sportsbooks for MLB betting.

Wagers include extra innings unless specified otherwise.

The game must start on the scheduled day (local stadium time) for bets to have action.

The game must go 9 innings or 8½ if the home team is winning for the run line to have action.

On ‘team to score first’ wagers, once a run is scored, the prop will be graded, regardless of how long the game lasts.

Wagers on postseason baseball series are based on the team to win the series, regardless of the number of games involved.

For player props, the player must be in the starting lineup for wagers to have action.

It’s important to read through the rules for baseball betting before placing your MLB bets, and you can find them in the terms and conditions section of your sportsbook’s website.
