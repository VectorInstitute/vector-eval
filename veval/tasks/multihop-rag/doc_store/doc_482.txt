In the post-race media conference, Mark Rushbrook, the Global Director for Ford Performance, was asked if winning the championship has any significance for the manufacturer as a whole in terms of marketing the brand globally.

Mark Rushbrook emphasized the importance of winning with the Mustang from a global marketing perspective. He stated, “Yeah, winning is everything for us, just as a point of pride. It’s certainly going to be a celebration in Dearborn. My phone has been blowing up with Ford family members and our senior executives already so excited about it. It means a lot internally to the customer because motorsports is so important to us.”

Rushbrook highlighted that success on the racetrack is the foundation of successful marketing programs. Winning races and championships builds credibility with fans and encourages them to engage with the brand. He explained, “That is the basis for successful marketing programs; it is success on the racetrack. So you have to win the races, you have to win championships to have that credibility, and for fans to engage with your brand and make them proud to have a Ford parked in their driveway or in their garage.”

While Ford’s racing program, featuring the Mustang, certainly boosts the sale of this iconic sports car, the Ford insider dropped an interesting fact. Rushbrook revealed, “For us, NASCAR, even though we’re racing a Mustang, we certainly sell Mustangs because of it. But we sell more F-150s to NASCAR fans. This is a proof point for them.”

The Ford F-150 truck, known for its ruggedness and reliability, has garnered a dedicated following among NASCAR enthusiasts. Winning the championship is not only about showcasing the Mustang but also the Ford-150, with which Ben Rhodes won his second Truck Series championship on Friday. This is also a testament to the power of NASCAR in influencing car-buying decisions.

Ford’s global marketing strategy also leverages the success of the Mustang in NASCAR, utilizing it as a marketing tool to promote their road cars worldwide. As the seventh generation Mustang continues to be sold globally as a road car, it’s racing not only in NASCAR but also in various international series, including Australia Supercars, Mustang GT3, Mustang GT4, and Dark Horse R with a Spec Challenge.

In essence, Ford takes the benefits from any Mustang’s racing success and uses it to market their cars globally. It’s a win-win situation for both the brand and racing enthusiasts. Although, all this might not have come to pass were it not for a timely intervention by “The Captain.”

In the post-race conference, the Team Penske driver expressed his frustration, stating, “There is no secret that I can snap on the radio. That’s been my whole life. That’s been my whole career. It’s just kind of something I do.” He described the intense battle with Ross Chastain, who blocked him multiple times, making it a tough fight.

The final push came when Blaney made contact with Chastain. A move made out of frustration, as he admitted. But at this crucial moment, team owner Roger Penske, often referred to as “The Captain,” stepped in. He reminded Blaney that he was not racing against Chastain but against the HMS duo. Penske’s calming influence helped Blaney regain composure, ensuring that he didn’t take any unnecessary risks. The result? A championship for Ryan Blaney and another testament to the guidance of “The Captain” in high-pressure situations.
