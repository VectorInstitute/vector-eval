Canada took a major step towards Copa America 2024 qualification as Stephen Eustaquio's 85th-minute strike gave them victory in their CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal first leg and a first win in Jamaica for 35 years.

Porto midfielder Eustaquio slotted in from Richie Laryea's surging run and low delivery, restoring the lead Canada had initially established through Jonathan David during first-half added time.

Shamar Nicholson fired in Jamaica's equaliser 13 minutes after the break but their opponents will seal their place at Copa America if they avoid defeat in the second leg at Ontario's BMO Field on Tuesday.

Jamaica vs Canada result

Score Goal scorers Jamaica 1 Shamar Nicholson (58) Canada 2 Jonathan David (45 +2), Stephen Eustaquio (85)

Starting lineups:

Jamaica (4-4-2, right to left): Blake (GK) ‚Äî Leigh, Pinnock, Bernard, Lembikisa ‚Äî Decordova-Reid, Latibeaudiere, Johnson, Bailey ‚Äî Antonio, Nicholson

Canada (4-4-2, right to left): Borjan (GK) ‚Äî Laryea, Vitoria, Miller, Adekugbe ‚Äî Buchanan, Kone, Eustaquio, Davies ‚Äî Larin, David

In a game rearranged for Saturday after heavy rain flooded parts of Kingston's Independence Park on Friday, David capitalised on a skilful turn and cross from Cyle Larin to score his 26th international goal as part of a dominant first half in which his side had four of the five attempts on target.

The Reggae Boyz went closest before David broke the deadlock, Aston Villa attacker Leon Bailey hitting the post with a shot from Bobby Decordova-Reid's corner.

Nicholson was aghast when his finish was initially ruled out for offside, only for a VAR intervention and pitchside monitor check by referee Mary Penso to justify Jamaica's celebrations in their technical area.

The Spartak Moscow forward had raced on to Daniel Johnson's quickly taken freekick and converted coolly to give Jamaica hope of extending their unbeaten run to six matches.

As well as a Copa America berth, the winners in three days' time will advance to the semifinals of the Nations League, where their opponents will be one of fellow quarterfinalists the USA, Trinidad and Tobago, Honduras, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama.

How can Canada qualify for the Copa America 2024?

The Rouges' task is now ostensibly straightforward: avoid defeat against Jamaica and they will be competing alongside the likes of reigning champions Argentina at the Copa America in the US when it starts in June.

Jamaica have never won in Canada, although they showed enough here ‚Äî in sunshine, mercifully, following the postponement of the game in torrential conditions the previous night ‚Äî to suggest they could spring an upset.

Their task will be made harder by the probable absence of Michail Antonio, while Bailey could not match speed and timing with accurate finishes when presented with good early chances.

West Ham United forward Antonio immediately signalled for treatment before limping down the tunnel with a possible hamstring injury during the first half.

Reaction from Steven Vitoria:



"It feels great to get our first win here in 35 years. It wasn't easy, far from it. Still a lot to be done but we're one step closer to where we want to go."#CANMNT pic.twitter.com/3YYwSNCgFm ‚Äî Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023

Lille striker David had two promising early opportunities, poking a shot into Milan Borjan's arms under pressure from two markers and applying a looping header to an Alphonso Davies cross, forcing the goalkeeper to backpedal and claim.

Even if they are knocked out on Wednesday, there will be another chance for the losers of the tie to reach the Copa America.

The ousted Nations League quarterfinalists will compete for two more qualification spots, and the calibre of teams in those playoffs is likely to be weaker, with the USA looking almost certain not to need that route following their 3-0 first-leg win over Trinidad and Tobago.

Eustaquio's first international goal since 2021 also ended Canada's run of two consecutive defeats and gave them a second win in seven matches.

Reaction from Milan Borjan:



"It feels amazing. What the boys did today, in this heat and on this pitch, is unbelievable. We need to come out again and show the brotherhood in Toronto. We need a full stadium there to give us that support." #CANMNT pic.twitter.com/lwuD0qLvp2 ‚Äî Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023

Jamaica vs Canada updates from rescheduled CONCACAF Nations League match

Fulltime: Jamaica 1-2 Canada

Canada will reach Copa America 2024 if they preserve their unbeaten record at home to Jamaica on Wednesday!

The hosts are a little unfortunate, having scored an equaliser and held out until five minutes from time, but they now face a huge task to reach the semifinals.

90 mins: Jamaica 1-2 Canada

Good news for Jamaica: there will be six minutes of added time.

87 mins: Jamaica 1-2 Canada

It's been 35 years since Canada have won in Jamaica. Now would be a great time to end that run and put them within touching distance of Copa America.

85 mins: GOAL ‚Äì Jamaica 1-2 Canada (Stephen Eustaquio)

Is that a huge goal for Canada?

Richie Laryea charges clear on the right, approaches the penalty area and cuts a perceptive low pass back into the path of the onrushing, unmarked Stephen Eustaquio, who slots in!

Watch:

82 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

There's some choreographed dancing going on in the stands involving fans in green shirts carrying yellow pompoms. Cheering scenes.

The official attendance is a little more than 3,500.

79 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Alphonso Davies shows some invention for Canada on the left, but the ball ends up in Andre Blake's arms.

76 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Leon Bailey is booked for an altercation with his marker. It's been a while since we've had a clear chance in this game ‚Äì settle for a draw all-round?

73 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

It's drinks break time. Canada emerged the stronger following the first-half drinks break...

70 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Canada have never lost at home to Jamaica, so you suspect they'll be satisfied with this result. Their opponents have shown enough to suggest they could spring a surprise in the return game, though.

67 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

A Canada substitution we could have mentioned...

SUBSTITUTION üîÅ



Mark-Anthony Kaye is coming on for Isma√´l Kon√©.#CANMNT pic.twitter.com/sljhsLwnT8 ‚Äî Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023

64 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Jamaica have a freekick beyond the halfway line. As usual, they send a string of players towards the penalty area. Milan Borjan catches the cross.

61 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Stephen Eust√°quio's freekick doesn't create a great deal of danger. Canada have only won one of their last 11 visits to Jamaica, and that record won't improve unless they can do better than that from opportunities.

60 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Canada have a freekick just outside the edge of the Jamaica penalty area on the left. This is promising. Andre Blake stands at his near post and directs some of his team-mates.

57 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Referee Mary Penso checked the pitchside monitor and agreed with Shamar Nicholson's protestations that the goal should have counted.

That goal came about because of a quick piece of thinking from Daniel Johnson, directing a freekick on to Shamar Nicholson's run while Canada appeared to have switched off.

56 mins: GOAL ‚Äì Jamaica 1-1 Canada (Shamar Nicholson)

Jamaica have the ball in the net after Shamar Nicholson bursts onto a pass inside the penalty area and produces a cool, low finish!

The visiting bench celebrate but their exuberance is cooled by an offside flag going up. There will be a VAR check...

54 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

Here's how Jamaica started.

51 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

Canada go close! Jonathan David nears the centre of the penalty area in a central position and lashes a dipping shot towards goal which Andre Blake does well to tip behind.

48 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

There's a scene that looks better suited to WWE as Richie Laryea and Shamar Nicholson both dive to the floor following a full-throttle tussle for the ball on the flank.

Referee Mary Penso rushes in to calm the situation down. Jamaica's Nicholson needs to keep his cool, having been booked during the first half.

46 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

Jamaica restart the action!

Halftime: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

It wasn't all plain sailing for Canada - especially when Leon Bailey struck a post with a shot - but they are good value for their lead after having 11 of the 16 attempts at goal during that half and four of the five on target.

This would be an excellent result for their prospects of qualifying for Copa America 2024, with the home leg to come for them.

45 mins +2: GOAL ‚Äì Jamaica 0-1 Canada (Jonathan David)

Canada take the lead! Cyle Larin responds to a bouncing ball inside the box by turning smartly to befuddle his two markers, then scythes a low delivery across the face of goal.

Jonathan David gratefully gobbles up the opportunity, tapping in at the far post!

Watch:

Jonathan David lights up the scoreboard for Canada! üá®üá¶ pic.twitter.com/bCVlAEQpge ‚Äî Concacaf Nations League (@CNationsLeague) November 18, 2023

45 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

End-to-end fare. Ethan Pinnock stops Jonathan David from getting a shot away inside the penalty area, and Andre Blake then punches Alphonso Davies' cross clear from a crowded box.

At the other end, Sam Adekugbe shows strength and speed to stop Trivante Stewart from racing clear onto a long ball.

44 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Bobby De Cordova-Reid almost set up an opener for Leon Bailey five minutes ago. This time he takes aim himself from a long way out, zipping a shot into Milan Borjan's arms.

41 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Milan Borjan is down for an extended period of treatment. The Canada goalkeeper was clutching his left calf.

Shamar Nicholson, who appeared to be the possible culprit, exchanges a hug with Borjan after he rises to his feet but is still booked for his trouble.

39 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Leon Bailey hits the crossbar! Bobby De Cordova-Reid sends a corner towards the far post, where Bailey beats his man with his run and sends his low first-time strike against the near post and away.

Jamaica could not have come any closer!

36 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Canada have had the better of the action since the drinks break. Alphonso Davies fails to beat the first defender with a corner from the right, but Canada find him in a good position on the same flank again, from where he whips a cross towards Jonathan David at the far post.

The forward loops a header back in the opposite direction, and the backtracking Andre Blake stretches to claim with reasonable ease.

33 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Alphonso Davies has a chance to send in a freekick from a useful position not far from the Jamaica penalty area in the right channel.

His low delivery bobbles through almost everyone before the hosts clear.

30 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

The action resumes with a goalkick to Canada. The game has been played at a ponderous pace at times ‚Äì you sense these teams need to up the ante if a breakthrough is to come before the interval, although perhaps both are happy to remain cagey during the early stages of the tie.

27 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Drinks break time. Jamaica coach Heimir Hallgrimsson is wearing a fetching back-to-front white baseball cap as he offers instructions to Trivante Stewart, among others.

A man in a marvellous yellow wig and black-and-yellow tracksuit can be seen in the stands, which are somewhat sparsely populated.

24 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Substitute Trivante Stewart turns and tries his luck from distance for Jamaica, to no avail.

These sides are yet to find their range yet.

21 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Ismael Kone sends a fierce shot from outside the penalty area wide for Canada.

Trivante Stewart has replaced Jamaica's Michail Antonio, who limped off a few minutes ago.

18 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Bad news for West Ham United fans: Michail Antonio is down for an extended period of time and asks to be substituted.

He eventually rises to his feet and hobbles down the tunnel, accompanied by medical staff. Speculatively, that could be a hamstring issue.

15 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Leon Bailey should have scored for Jamaica again! An aerial ball down the flank bounces kindly for the Aston Villa attacker inside the penalty area on the left, deceiving Steven Vitoria.

Bailey drags his first-time shot wide of the far post. Heimir Hallgrimsson applauds as Bailey's runs continue to cause Canada problems.

13 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Leon Bailey can only nod the freekick on. Milan Borjan scoops the ball up in Canada's goal.

12 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Jamaica win a freekick beyond the halfway line on the right and load the box. Well, it's not quite the penalty area, but there's a long line of players awaiting the delivery just outside of it.

9 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Best chance so far for Canada! Jonathan David breaks free inside the Jamaica penalty area on the right, sending Greg Leigh off balance and coming under pressure from Daniel Johnson as he closes in on goal.

The striker can only poke a low shot gently towards goalkeeper Andre Blake, who gathers.

7 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

There isn't a great deal of action to report in the sunshine. Here's how Canada looked before kickoff.

4 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Jamaica should have scored! Leon Bailey is through on goal from a long ball but produces a tame, rushed finish that drops comfortably wide of Milan Borjan's goal with the goalkeeper well off his line.

Manager Heimir Hallgrimsson turns and shows his frustration on the sideline, while Bailey - justifiably - looks sheepish. That was well short of the quality he's capable of.

2 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Leon Bailey canters along the left flank and sends in a dangerous low cross which Canada do well to clear. Bailey is adjudged to have been offside.

1 min: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Glorious-looking conditions in Kingston this morning, thankfully, with sunshine and a picturesque, tree-filled backdrop to this stadium.

It's a quiet start between these sides, Jamaica in their familiar yellow and green home strip, Canada in dark blue.

1 hour 40 mins to kickoff: The conditions this morning in Jamaica are more promising, if the hosts' latest post on social media is any measure...

Good Morning Jamaica. Just a reminder kick off is at 10:30am.

UPDATE (8:35 p.m. ET): Canada Soccer has made the postponement official, as the match will kick at 10:30 a.m. ET (7:30 a.m. PT) tomorrow morning .

Nothing else was announced as far as what should happen if the pitch remains water logged. That means one of two things: either the federations haven't sorted that out yet, or they are looking to keep that in-house as not to risk publicly announce plans for something that never ends up happening.

Here's to hoping that won't be necessary anyways, and tomorrow morning's kickoff can proceed as planned!

UPDATE (8:25 p.m. ET): **GAME POSTPONED UNTIL TOMORROW**

The match has been called off for the evening, and they will try again tomorrow. Journalists have announced that the match has been pushed back until 10:30 a.m. ET / 7:30 a.m. PT. No official word from the federation yet, but this seems as concrete as ever.

They tried to wait it out tonight, but it just wasn't to be.

When Canada Soccer make the decision official, we will pass that information along as well as any contingency plan made public as well for if the pitch remains unplayable at the new time.

50 mins to potential kickoff: No word on tonight's match inside an hour until the possible kick time is not good news, as further delay could mean the federation's officials are hashing out alternate plans.

It sounds like a decision will be made soon on whether tonight's match can go ahead. If it is necessary to push the game back, they would likely try to play tomorrow, but if the pitch is still unplayable at that point, then further action would need to be taken.

It's possible for them to cancel the first leg and simply play the second leg in Canada, but the teams would have to agree to that. It would put Jamaica at a serious disadvantage in a matchup with significant ramifications ‚Äî Copa America qualification ‚Äî on the line.

1 hour to potential kickoff: There is still no update on whether this game will take place tonight, or if so, what time. At least the players are keeping themselves loose as they wait for the weather to lighten up!

1 hour 30 mins to potential kick: No updates have been released since the previous delay. Lineups have yet to be announced with the viability of the match still in flux. Here's a reminder of what this match means from a tangible competitive standpoint, whether it should be played tonight or on a future date.

This was the update we expected, as Canada Soccer have announced that the match will not kick off before at least 9 p.m. ET. However, it does appear more and more likely that a game will indeed take place tonight. Will it clear up enough to create a playable surface, or has there been too much rain to proceed safely? We'll find out soon.

If played, the rain-soaked conditions could rival those of the match Canada played in Honduras in the summer of 2022, which was wet and wild.

50 mins 1 hour 50 mins to potential kick: ** Tonight's match will not kick off on time**

Our first true update from Canada Soccer concerning tonight's match states that kickoff has been pushed back at least an hour. The statement claims that the match will not kickoff before 8 p.m. ET, language which seems to leave the possibility open for further postponements or even calling off the game. We will keep you updated as we get more information.

1 hour 15 mins to kick: The weather in Kingston is torrential, and it's been raining hard for quite some time now. It's at the point where you wonder if this match will even take place, and there seems to be some initial chatter of it possibly being called off. Postponing international matches is extremely difficult, but player safety has to be considered.

They will have to make a call soon, as starting lineups are due in 15 minutes.

1 hour 30 mins to kick: Copa America qualification is on the line for both these teams across the two quarterfinal legs. Advancement to the CONCACAF Nations League semifinals is enough to book a place in next summer's competition.

The defeated team can, however, still qualify if they win their subsequent playoff matchup with another quarterfinal loser, which takes place in March. Still, that's a tense and difficult prospect, and both sides will with to avoid that precarious situation, as missing out on the Copa America would be a monumental disappointment for both Canada and Mexico.

2 hours to kickoff: While the Canadian federation is reeling from the departure of John Herdman, one player is happy to see change happen at the top. Central midfielder Mark-Anthony Kaye had been left out of multiple squads towards the end of Herdman's tenure, and he believes his relationship with the former Canada head coach was the reason.

Me and John had some really tough conversations where he blatantly told me I wasn‚Äôt good enough to be part of the team. That was hard for me to accept,‚Äù Kaye said to Sportsnet, after also posting to social media an honest self-reflection following his New England Revolution's elimination from the MLS playoffs a week ago.

Jamaica vs Canada lineups & team news

Jamaica manager Hallgrimsson also described his side as being on a mission, but they faced it without New York Red Bulls forward Cory Burke because of a groin problem.

Karoy Anderson, who plays for English club Charlton Athletic, was called up for the first time. "I was just shocked," the midfielder told the Addicks' website. "I was looking at it for a long time just taking it in and I told my mum and she started crying."
