In sports betting, betting on totals is a favorite option alongside point spreads and moneylines.

Rather than pick the winner or the winning margin, with totals betting (a.k.a. over/unders), you predict the game’s combined score.

In the sections below, we'll explain totals betting completely incluidng its main attributes, over/under examples from multiple sports, and some totals betting pointers for both novice and seasoned bettors.

What is an over/under bet?

A totals bet, commonly known as an over/under bet, involves betting on the combined score of both teams in a game.

Bookmakers set a predicted total score for the game, and bettors choose whether they think the actual combined score will surpass (over) or fall short of (under) that number.

For instance, if an NBA betting site sets the total for a basketball game at 210.5 points, those who bet the "over" would win if the combined score of the two teams is 211 or more.

Those who bet the "under" would win if the score totals 210 or less. The 0.5 ensures no chance of a tie, as teams can't score in half-points.

Your only concern is whether the final combined score will fall over or under the line set by oddsmakers.

How do over/under odds work?

When placing totals wagers, you’ll see odds listed alongside the over/under number. These odds indicate the potential payout for the bet.

Typically, the odds for totals bets are close to even, ranging from -105 to -120.

This narrow range reflects the bookmakers' belief that the event has a roughly even chance of going either way, with neither the over nor the under being heavily favored.

Does the totals line move or change?

Yes, the totals line can move. The line movement occurs in response to various factors:

Betting Activity: One of the most common reasons for line movement is a significant amount of money being wagered on one side (either over or under). Bookmakers adjust the line to balance the action and protect themselves from potential losses.

Injury Updates: If a key player is injured or unable to play, this can influence the expected total score, leading bookmakers to adjust the line accordingly.

Other News and Updates: Any news that might affect the performance of the teams, such as changes in team strategy or recent performances, can influence totals lines.

Totals betting outcomes

When placing an over/under wager, there are a few potential outcomes to consider. If the combined score exceeds the set total, the "over" bet wins.

Conversely, if the score is below the set total, the "under" bet wins. If the combined score of the game matches the total, the bet is typically considered a "push," and the wager is refunded.

Now, let’s break down those three scenarios.

Totals win

Imagine the NBA over/under odds for a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics is 220.5 points. If a bettor believes that the game will be high-scoring and that the teams' combined score will exceed this mark, they might place an "over" bet.

The game then unfolds, and the Lakers score 115 points while the Celtics score 110, resulting in a combined score of 225 points. Since 225 exceeds the set total of 220.5, the bettor who wagered on the "over" wins their bet.

Totals loss

Suppose a top sports betting app sets a total of 200.5 points for an NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls.

If a bettor believes the game will be defensive and low-scoring, they might place an "under" bet, predicting that the combined score of both teams will be 200 points or less.

However, if the game turns out to be offensively charged and the Knicks score 105 points while the Bulls score 100 points, the combined score becomes 205 points. Since 205 exceeds the set total of 200.5, the bettor who wagered on the "under" loses their bet.

Push

A push occurs when the combined score of a game matches the set total established by the bookmaker, meaning that bettors neither win nor lose, and their original wager is refunded. However, to avoid this outcome, most sportsbooks employ half-points in their totals.

By using half points, such as setting a total at 200.5 instead of 200, the sports betting sites ensure that a game's combined score cannot possibly match the set total exactly.

Totals betting by sport

Over/under betting is a major draw across many popular sports. Let’s break down how it can look across sports.

Over/under odds in football

Let's consider some NFL over/under odds between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles.

The bookmaker sets the over/under total at 47.5 points for the combined score of both teams. A bettor believes it will be a high-scoring game and places an "over" bet.

The game concludes with the Cowboys scoring 28 points and the Eagles scoring 24 points, leading to a combined score of 52 points. Since 52 exceeds the set total of 47.5, the bettor who wagered on the "over" wins their bet.

Over/under odds in basketball

Imagine NBA over/under odds between the Charlotte Hornets and the Houston Rockets. The bookmaker sets the over/under total at 215.5 points for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, expecting a defensive showdown, places an "under" bet.

The game ends with the Hornets scoring 105 points and the Rockets scoring 108 points, yielding a combined score of 213 points. Since 213 is below the set total of 215.5, the bettor who wagered on the "under" successfully wins their bet.

Over/under odds in baseball

Let's look at MLB over/under odds between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The bookmaker establishes the over/under total at 8.5 runs for the combined score of both teams.

A bettor, thinking it'll be an offensively charged game with both teams having their best hitters in the lineup, places an "over" bet. The game wraps up with the Yankees scoring 5 runs and the Red Sox tallying up 6 runs, resulting in a combined score of 11 runs.

Since 11 exceeds the set total of 8.5, the bettor who wagered on the "over" comes out on top.

Over/under odds in hockey

Let's consider NHL over/under odds between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.

The bookmaker sets the over/under total at 5.5 goals for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, anticipating a game dominated by goalkeepers and defense, places an "under" bet.

The game ends with the Maple Leafs netting 3 goals and the Canadiens scoring 2, leading to a combined score of 5 goals. Since 5 is below the set total of 5.5, the bettor who opted for the "under" secures a win on their wager.

Over/under odds in soccer

Let's take some Premier League soccer odds between Manchester United and Chelsea. The bookmaker determines the over/under total at 2.5 goals for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, feeling that both teams have been on a scoring spree lately, places an "over" bet.

The match ends with Manchester United scoring 2 goals and Chelsea netting 2 as well, resulting in a combined score of 4 goals. Since 4 surpasses the set total of 2.5, the bettor who wagered on the "over" enjoys a winning bet.

Over/under odds in MMA

In an MMA context, over/under bets often refer to the duration of the fight rather than points or scores. Let's consider a UFC bout between Fighter A and Fighter B. The bookmaker sets an over/under line at 2.5 rounds for the fight's duration.

A bettor, believing that both fighters have aggressive styles and the fight will conclude early, places an "under" bet. If the fight ends midway through the second round due to a knockout or submission, the total rounds would be 1.5.

Since this is below the set total of 2.5 rounds, the bettor who wagered on the "under" wins their bet. Conversely, if the fight extends beyond the midway point of the third round, "over" bets would win.

Over/under odds in tennis

At tennis betting sites, over/under betting typically revolves around the total number of games or sets played in a match. Let's consider a Grand Slam match between Player A and Player B. The bookmaker sets the over/under total at 40.5 games for the entire match.

A bettor, anticipating a closely contested match with many extended sets, places an "over" bet. The match unfolds with the following set scores: 7-5, 6-7, 7-6, and 6-4. The combined total number of games played is 42. Since 42 exceeds the set total of 40.5, the bettor who wagered on the "over" wins their bet.

Over/under odds in golf

At golf betting sites, over/under betting often pertains to a golfer's score for a specific round or the entire tournament relative to par. Let's consider a major tournament where a notable golfer, say Rory McIlroy, is playing. The bookmaker sets an over/under line at 69.5 strokes for his first-round score.

A bettor, analyzing the challenging course conditions and believing McIlroy might face difficulties, places an "under" bet, predicting he'll finish the round in 69 strokes or fewer.

If McIlroy concludes the round with a score of 68, which is 3 under par on a par-71 course, the bettor's "under" wager wins. Conversely, if McIlroy shoots a 70 or higher, those who bet the "over" would win.

Totals betting FAQ

How do over/under bets work?

Over/under bets, also known as totals bets, involve wagering on whether a particular number (like combined points scored in a game, total rounds in a fight, or total games in a tennis match) will be over or under the figure set by the bookmaker.

Does overtime count in totals wagering?

Yes, in most sports and with the majority of sportsbooks, overtime does count toward your totals wager. Always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you are betting with to confirm, but generally, overtime is included in totals wagers.

Why does the over/under betting line change?

Sportsbooks set game totals considering factors like recent performances, weather, and player status. As new data emerges and betting trends develop, this line can shift.

For instance, if many bettors choose the "over," the sportsbook might raise the total to balance the bets. Line movements often reflect public betting sentiments and offer insights to informed bettors. Therefore, bettors must monitor any line changes before the game starts and strategize accordingly to optimize their betting success.

Is it better to bet over or under?

Neither wager holds a universal advantage. Success in over/under betting hinges on a thorough evaluation of both the set line and the competing teams.

How do you read an over/under bet?

Reading a total bet involves understanding the combined score set by the sportsbook and the odds associated with that number. When you see a total, such as 210.5 in a basketball game, it represents the combined score anticipated from both teams. Beside this number, you'll typically find "over" and "under" options.

If you believe the actual combined score will surpass this number, you'd bet on the "over." Conversely, if you think it will be less, you'd choose the "under." Accompanying these options are odds that indicate the payout for the bet.

For instance, odds of -110 (extremely common) mean you'd need to wager $110 to win an additional $100. Evaluating both the total and the associated odds is crucial for informed betting decisions.
