It’s another Prime Day — or Prime Big Deal Days, in Amazon parlance — which means another day to save a dollar or two on some great new gear for your smart home. Whether you’re looking for a robot helper to clean your floors, an extra set of eyes to watch over your property, or another smart speaker to bark commands at Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, there are some good bargains to be had during Amazon’s fall Prime Day event.

As usual, robot vacuums are seeing some decent sales, including on the top-of-the-line models that don’t see discounts as often as the rest of the bunch. (My advice is to never buy a bot that’s not on sale because they’re always on sale.) Ecovacs’ newest flagship robot vacuum, the X2 Omni, launched last week and is already $200 off. I’ve started testing it, and it’s an impressive machine; its square shape gives it the advantage of getting into corners better than most rounder bots.

The higher-end Ring smart security cameras are also getting deep discounts: the Ring Pro 2 video doorbell and Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro add radar motion detection and better video quality over the base models. These are rarely on sale and are seeing up to $100 off.

Here’s a roundup of some of the best deals on good products that I’ve spotted so far. I’ll update this throughout the sale event, so check back often.
