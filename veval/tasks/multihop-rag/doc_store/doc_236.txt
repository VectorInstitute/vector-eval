Amazon’s fall Prime Day event is underway. For more deals we recommend across all categories, check out our full roundup here.

Amazon Prime Day is one of the best times of the year to save on a wide variety of video games. Titles released in the last few months are getting some decent discounts (which still beats paying full price), and many older games from the last few years fall to their best bargain-bin prices (which is great for stocking up on those “Man, I’ve been meaning to get around to that one” games).
