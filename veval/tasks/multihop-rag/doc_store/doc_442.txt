Their otherworldly talents have continuously captivated the fans across the globe. While LeBron James and Stephen Curry may have accumulated more championships and accolades, Kevin Durant, without a doubt, is universally acknowledged as the best pure talent of his generation.

Kevin Durant stands as one of the most exceptionally skilled players in NBA history. Across his illustrious 17-year career in the league, Durant has solidified his status as a transcendent superstar. His stellar performances over the years have endeared him to millions of fans. However, even with his exceptional talents, Kevin Durant regularly faces disregard from both the media and fans. This has made KD one of the most polarizing figures in basketball. Yet, when one considers the profound impact Durant has made on the NBA, the extent of the disrespect he encounters can seem perplexing at times.

It would be an understatement to say that Kevin Durant divides opinions. While some view him as the most skilled basketball player of his generation, others perceive him as a diva who rode the coattails of Stephen Curry to secure his two NBA championships. However, a careful consideration of Kevin Durant’s game-changing impact and the multitude of accolades he has garnered throughout his illustrious career reveals a glaring reality: KD stands as perhaps the most disrespected icon of the sport.

Kevin Durant rose to prominence in 2007, when the Seattle SuperSonics drafted him with the No.2 pick. The NBA had never witnessed a player possessing Durant’s unique skill set—a 6’11” forward renowned for his exceptional jump-shot and lethal three-point accuracy. He epitomized the concept of a “Unicorn” in its truest sense.

Moreover, when one pays close attention to his stats, the disrespect becomes even more perplexing. Kevin Durant has amassed 27,393 points in the regular season, ranking 11th in NBA history. In the playoffs, he has contributed an additional 4,878 points, placing him 7th on the all-time list. Durant is a surefire future first-ballot Hall of Famer, boasting an illustrious resume that few can match. His accomplishments include two NBA titles, two NBA finals MVP awards, four scoring titles, and multiple selections to the All-Star and All-NBA teams.

Durant’s scuffles with critics

While Durant may rank among the greatest NBA players in history, his vulnerability to criticism and thin-skinned nature has, on several occasions, has got the better of him. NBA legend Charles Barkley called Durant “sensitive” in an interview with 60 Minutes. He said, “He’s very sensitive. Great player. He’s part of that generation who thinks he can’t be criticized.”

Durant’s susceptibility to criticism became glaringly evident when he utilized a burner account in 2017 to defend himself on Twitter. However, Durant was exposed when he inadvertently failed to switch accounts, posting a tweet through his verified account. Fans also criticize KD for his lack of leadership and his lack of titles since departing from the Warriors. Since his departure in 2019, Durant has not secured an NBA title. Despite forming a formidable trio with Kyrie Irving and James Harden in Brooklyn, their best result was a second-round exit in the 2021 playoffs at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks.

Fans and media strongly disapprove of Kevin Durant’s inclination to switch teams repeatedly, even when he receives substantial support from the organizations. After his Brooklyn experiment didn’t work, KD requested a trade and, on last year’s trade deadline, his wish was granted as the Nets traded him to the Suns. Despite having NBA stars like Devin Booker and Chris Paul as teammates, Durant once again fell short of winning a title with the Suns. Durant’s inability to clinch an NBA title without Curry and the Warriors has heightened the narrative that questions his status as an icon of the game.

The decision that tainted Durant’s legacy

In the 2016 Western Conference finals, KD-Russ led OKC Thunder faced off against 73-9 Warriors. After swiftly securing a 3-1 series lead, the Thunder seemed poised for an NBA Finals appearance. However, the Warriors orchestrated a remarkable comeback, ultimately winning the series in seven games. This meant that Durant would go trophy-less for another season.

In the 2016 offseason, Durant made a pivotal decision to join the very team that had defeated him in the finals. This move had profound consequences, leading to a shift in public opinion, with many labeling him as a “snake” and “spineless.” While Durant achieved the success he craved for in the Bay Area, his decision to join the Warriors has permanently cast a shadow on his legacy.
