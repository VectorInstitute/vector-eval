To study the efficiency and safety of holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy for ureteral stones.
A series of 188 patients with 208 ureteral stones were treated with semirigid ureteroscopy and holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy from January 2003 to December 2005. Of the stones, 116 were lower ureteral, 37 middle ureteral, and 55 upper ureteral.
The success rate was 92.7% at the time of ureteroscopy and 96.7% at 3 months. The failures were secondary to retropulsion of the stones (3.3%). There were no perforations and one stricture. Stenting was done in 90% of patients.
