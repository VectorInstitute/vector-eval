In the Philippines, the current national control strategy for schistosomiasis is annual mass drug administration (MDA) with 40 mg/kg of praziquantel in all schistosomiasis-endemic villages with a prevalence ≥10%.
A cross-sectional survey of schistosomiasis was conducted in 2012 on 18 221 individuals residing in 22 schistosomiasis-endemic villages in the province of Northern Samar. The prevalence of schistosomiasis, intensity of Schistosoma infection, and morbidity of disease were assessed.
Despite an active schistosomiasis-control program in Northern Samar for>30 years, which included a MDA campaign in the last 5 years, the mean prevalence of schistosomiasis among 10 435 evaluated subjects was 27.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.3%-28.0%), and the geometric mean intensity of infection among 2832 evaluated subjects was 17.2 eggs per gram of feces (95% CI, 16.4-18.1). Ultrasonography revealed high levels of schistosomiasis-induced morbidity in the schistosomiasis-endemic communities. Left lobe liver enlargement (≥70 mm) was evident in 89.3% of subjects. Twenty-five percent of the study population had grade II/III liver parenchyma fibrosis, and 13.3% had splenomegaly (≥100 mm).
