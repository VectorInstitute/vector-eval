Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has become the gold standard treatment for small (less than 6 cm) adrenal masses. However, the role of LA for large-volume (more than 6 cm) masses has not been well defined. Our aim was to evaluate, retrospectively, the outcome of LA for adrenal lesions larger than 7 cm.
18 consecutive laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed from 1996 to 2005 on patients with adrenal lesions larger than 7 cm.
The mean tumor size was 8.3 cm (range 7-13 cm), the mean operative time was 137 min, the mean blood loss was 182 mL (range 100-550 mL), the rate of intraoperative complications was 16%, and in three cases we switched from laparoscopic procedure to open surgery.
