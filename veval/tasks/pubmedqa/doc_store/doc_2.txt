The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible.
Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2).
Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p<0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%).
