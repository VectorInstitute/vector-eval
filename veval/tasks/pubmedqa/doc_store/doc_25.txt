The use of a balloon expandable stent valve includes balloon predilatation of the aortic stenosis before valve deployment. The aim of the study was to see whether or not balloon predilatation is necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI).
Sixty consecutive TAVI patients were randomized to the standard procedure or to a protocol where balloon predilatation was omitted.
There were no significant differences between the groups regarding early hemodynamic results or complication rates.
