Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. We evaluated heart dimensions in hypertensive patients with MetS.
The study included 75 hypertensive patients (34 males, 41 females; mean age 51+/-9 years) without coronary artery disease. Patients were evaluated in two groups depending on the presence or absence of MetS. Age- and gender-matched 20 healthy subjects (9 males, 11 females; mean age 50+/-5 years) comprised the control group. The diagnosis of MetS was based on the presence of at least three of five MetS criteria. Hypertension was defined as arterial blood pressure exceeding 140/85 mmHg on three consecutive measurements or the use of antihypertensive drugs. Echocardiographic measurements included interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular internal diameter, posterior wall thickness, aortic diameter, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass.
Metabolic syndrome was present in 32 hypertensive patients (42.7%; 18 males, 14 females). The mean number of MetS criteria was 2.6+/-1.0 in the hypertensive group. Compared to the control group, patients with or without MetS exhibited significantly increased interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass (p<0.05). The only significant difference between the two patient groups was that MetS was associated with a greater left atrial diameter (p=0.019). Left atrial diameter was correlated with the number of MetS criteria (r=0.51; p<0.001).
