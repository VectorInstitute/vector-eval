Desmopressin releases tissue-type plasminogen activator, which augments cardiopulmonary bypass--associated hyperfibrinolysis, causing excessive bleeding. Combined use of desmopressin with prior administration of the antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid may decrease fibrinolytic activity and might improve postoperative hemostasis.
This prospective randomized study was carried out with 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operations between April 1999 and November 2000 in GÃ¼lhane Military Medical Academy. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Desmopressin (0.3 microg/kg) was administrated just after cardiopulmonary bypass and after protamine infusion in group 1 (n = 50). Both desmopressin and tranexamic acid (before the skin incision at a loading dose of 10 mg/kg over 30 minutes and followed by 12 hours of 1 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) were administrated in group 2 (n = 50).
Significantly less drainage was noted in group 2 (1010 +/- 49.9 mL vs 623 +/- 41.3 mL, P =.0001). Packed red blood cells were transfused at 2.1 +/- 0.5 units per patient in group 1 versus 0.9 +/- 0.3 units in group 2 (P =.0001). Fresh frozen plasma was transfused at 1.84 +/- 0.17 units per patient in group 1 versus 0.76 +/- 0.14 units in group 2 (P =.0001). Only 24% of patients in group 2 required donor blood or blood products compared with 74% of those in the isolated desmopressin group (group 1, P =.00001). Group 1 and group 2 findings were as follows: postoperative fibrinogen, 113 +/- 56.3 mg/dL versus 167 +/- 45.8 mg/dL (P =.0001); fibrin split product, 21.2 +/- 2.3 ng/mL versus 13.5 +/- 3.4 ng/mL (P =.0001); and postoperative hemoglobin level, 7.6 plus minus 1.2 g/dL versus 9.1 plus minus 1.2 g/dL (P =.0001).
