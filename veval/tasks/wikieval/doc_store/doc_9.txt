FoodFutureCo is a scale-up accelerator for purpose-driven food businesses. FoodFutureCo was founded by Shen Tong, American social activist and investor in 2016 to support post-revenue food companies who are primed to expand from early adoption to early majority. The accelerator program works with companies in agtech, agriculture, consumer packaged goods, local & plant-based foods, sustainable seafood, restaurant concepts, and food waste. The handful of companies within each cohort are established yet small companies with massive skill potential.
