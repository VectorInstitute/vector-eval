The Uzbekistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan Railway Project is an extensive project undertaking with the objective of creating a direct railway link between Uzbekistan and Pakistan, passing through Afghanistan's territory. This project aims to enhance trade and logistics efficiency by establishing a 573-km rail connection that would connect Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, to Kabul and Peshawar, the capitals of Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively.

Project Details
The estimated cost of the project is US$4.8 billion, and its implementation is anticipated to strengthen trade relations between Pakistan and South Asia. The trilateral agreement spanning 760 kilometers was signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan, aiming to significantly reduce cargo delivery times between Uzbekistan and Pakistan by approximately five days.The railway route will traverse through Termez, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Logar in Afghanistan, and continue to the Kharlachi border crossing in Pakistan's northwestern Kurram district. Designed to facilitate both passenger and freight services, the railway is poised to foster regional trade and contribute to overall economic growth in the area.
