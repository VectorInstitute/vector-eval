History
The Yingshang No. 1 tram route, a predecessor to Trolleybus Route 20, was opened by the British Shanghai Tramways on 21 January 1908 and ran between the Jing'an Temple and The Bund.Trolleybus Route 20 opened on 27 September 1928, initially operating between Zhongshan Park and the Jing'an Temple. After the removal of tram tracks along Nanjing Road in 1963, Yingshang No. 1 was merged into Route 20, forming a single trolleybus route that ran between Zhongshan Park and The Bund.In 1999, after part of East Nanjing Road was converted to a pedestrian-only shopping street, Route 20 was rerouted to skip the segment via Jiujiang Road.In 2019, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all 25 trolleybuses running along the route were decorated with pictures depicting the history of the route. That year, it was estimated that as many as 9 out of 10 Shanghai residents had ridden on the route.In the same year, after the entire East Nanjing Road was made pedestrian-only, the terminus was shifted from Jiujiang Road & East No.1 Zhongshan Road to Hankou Road & Middle Sichuan Road.

Fleet
As of May 2023, the route runs on a fleet of 22 Sunwin SWB5129BEV77G trolleybuses. These buses bear a blue retro livery, commemorating the heritage of trams and trolleybuses in Shanghai. Unlike other trolleybuses of the same type, those on Route 20 have a line of text saying "Since 1928", alluding to the year the route was introduced. These buses were piloted in July 2022 and entered service in September.
